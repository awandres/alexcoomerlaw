If our solution as a country is for people to trade one form of debt for another, albeit in a smaller amount, I\u2019m disappointed in our politicians\u2019 ability to problem solve.  Put another way, debt swapping simply is not a solution.  Moreover, massive debt forgiveness does not do anything to fix the future problem moving forward about the excessive cost of higher education and how future students will affordably finance education. Instead of an over-simplified debt forgiveness program, I proffer that there are a number of other ways, which all work together, that can address this issue holistically and do not have the same moral shortcomings as outright debt forgiveness. "),o.a.createElement("p",null,"The first step is to forgive ALL accumulated Interest on Student Loans and peg all student loan borrowing at 0% moving forward.  Personally, this author is offended by the fact that the government is charging between 6.8%-7.8% on student loans when the rate of borrowing is presently so much cheaper for other forms of consumer debt.  The unfortunate reality is that a high interest rate on high dollar figures borrowed, like student loans, is why many consumers end up paying minimum payments for decades without actually knocking any of the original principal amount owed down.  It is a debt hole of death.  Even despite your best effort to make timely payments, the debt does not go down and can sometimes just keep getting bigger and bigger.   This sort of debt cycle must be stopped and addressed by Congress as consumers simply cannot and do not have the financial leverage to get themselves out on their own.  "),o.a.createElement("p",null,"The obvious and easy solution here is to fix the interest rate on student loans to 0% and forgive all interest charges that have accumulated to date.  In other words, Congress should legislate forgiveness of just accumulated interest on student loans over the years and not forgive the student loan principal balance itself.  At the same time, any payments made to date by the borrower should retroactively apply to principal amounts borrowed and not to interest accumulation. Interest payments made by borrowers who already paid their student loans back in-full should be refunded.  The government has no reason to profit on the back of student loan borrowers or create a debt cycle that is impossible to emerge from.   From a purely academic tax-income perspective, forgiveness of interest accumulation is different from forgiveness of actual income received in the forms of dispersed student loans.
