He knows the community and he is here to help.</p>\n\n      <p>After graduating from the University of Arizona in 2008 at the start of the great recession, Alex struggled to find any sort of a job right out of school.  Instead, Alex ambitiously opened his own small business -- a restaurant in Picture Rocks, Arizona.  The build out process was extensive and expensive, yet, resulted in a functioning and operating restaurant.  Nevertheless, the economic reality of the time was not conducive to opening a restaurant and the business barely kept afloat.  </p>\n\n      <p>After nearly two years of restaurant operations, surviving on a month-to-month basis, Alex was able to sell the business and start to rebuild his own personal economic situation.  Small business ownership during a recession took a large financial toll on Alex, but through the grace of others and some hard work, he was able to barely avoid filing for bankruptcy.  </p>\n\n            <p>As a bankruptcy attorney today, this experience of running a nearly failed business during a recession is always on Alex’s mind.  He is sympathetic and empathetic to what it feels like as a small business owner waking up in the middle of night worrying about bills and the money you do not have, because he was there himself. </p>\n\n      <p>In June of 2020, Alex opened his own solo practice law firm specializing in personal bankruptcies because the COVID pandemic changed our community and the world.  The sad unfolding reality of the COVID situation, and the uncertainty of the future, will drive many hard-working, well-intentioned, and honest people and business owners into financial problems.  </p>\n\n<p>Alex’s solo practice is focused squarely on helping Arizonans understand how the Bankruptcy code may be helpful to reset their situation, find solutions, and create a path forward unburdened by creditors and collection agencies.  Alex is passionate about finding answers and being an ally to honest debtors to help find the path towards financial independence and freedom. </p>\n\n\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Home\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport {\n  Route,\n  Link,\n  HashRouter\n} from 'react-router-dom'\nimport Social from './Social'\n\n\nclass About extends Component {\n\n  componentDidMount () {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n  }\n\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <div id='body'>\n        <div class='about-pg-banner'>\n\n          <div class='services-hero'>\n            <h1>ABOUT</h1>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='about-pg-container'>\n          <div class='about-pg-content'>\n            <h3 class=''>A Little Background Information on Alex Coomer:</h3>\n\n            <img class='about-img' src='assets/img/alex-vacation.jpeg' /><p>Richard Alexander Coomer (Alex) was raised in Tucson, Arizona.

Nevertheless, the economic reality of the time was not conducive to opening a restaurant and the business barely kept afloat.</p>\n\n            <p>After nearly two years of restaurant operations, surviving on a month-to-month basis, Alex was able to sell the business and start to rebuild his own personal economic situation.  Small business ownership during a recession took a large financial toll on Alex, but through the grace of others and some hard work, he was able to barely avoid filing for bankruptcy.</p>\n\n            <p>As a bankruptcy attorney today, this experience of running a nearly failed business during a recession is always on Alex’s mind.  He is sympathetic and empathetic to what it feels like as a small business owner waking up in the middle of night worrying about bills and the money you do not have, because he was there himself.</p>\n\n            <p>After business ownership, Alex worked as a process server and legal courier before enrolling at the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law.  In May of 2014, Alex graduated from Law School, passed the bar exam, and was admitted as a practicing attorney shortly thereafter.</p>\n\n            <p>Alex’s clerked for Judge Carmine Cornelio (ret.) at the Pima County Superior Court. Afterwards, from 2015-2018, he practiced as a felony trial attorney at the Pima County Public Defender's Office.  As a public defender, Alex vigorously represented indigent individuals accused of crimes ranging from simple drug possession, through armed robbery, and murder.</p>\n\n            <p>After leaving the Public Defender’s Office, he moved to Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  Along with his girlfriend at the time, and now wife, Alex taught geography and law to Cambodian students at American University of Phnom Penh.  Alex returned to the United States in the winter of 2019 and clerked for Judge Howard Fell at the Pima County Superior Court.</p>\n            <div class='about-img-block'>\n              <img class='dog-1-img' src='assets/img/alex-dog-1.jpeg' />\n              <img class='bird-img' src='assets/img/alex-bird.jpeg' />\n              <img class='dog-2-img' src='assets/img/alex-dog-2.jpeg' />\n\n            </div>\n            <p>In June of 2020, Alex opened his own solo practice law firm specializing in personal bankruptcies because the COVID pandemic changed our community and the world.  The sad unfolding reality of the COVID situation, and the uncertainty of the future, will drive many hard-working, well-intentioned, and honest people and business owners into financial problems.</p>\n\n            <p>Alex’s solo practice is focused squarely on helping Arizonans understand how the Bankruptcy code may be helpful to reset their situation, find solutions, and create a path forward unburdened by creditors and collection agencies.  Alex is passionate about finding answers and being an ally to honest debtors to help find the path towards financial independence and freedom.</p>\n\n            <p>When he is not working, Alex spends much of his free time gardening, watching sports (especially anything U of A related), listening to classical music, playing soccer, and spending as much time as possible with his two dogs, Frederick Chopin (Fred) and Charles IV (Charlie).  Alex enjoys playing chess in his spare time, is an avid hummingbird watcher and, as soon as it is safe to do so, intends to travel to new and exotic places.</p>\n\n            <div class='lawyer-pic-block'>\n              <img class='lawyer-about-pic' src='assets/img/alex4.jpg' />\n              <div class=\"flex-col\">\n              <div class='quote-section-about'>\n                <p class='quote-p'>“The federal system of bankruptcy is designed not only to distribute the property of the debtor, not by law exempted, fairly and equally among his creditors, but as a main purpose of the act, <strong>intends to aid the unfortunate debtor by giving him a fresh start in life, free from debts, except of a certain character,</strong> after the property which he owned at the time of bankruptcy has been administered for the benefit of creditors.

Pre-Bankruptcy planning and assistance helps you understand your financial situation in order to have a plan in place to protect as much property as lawfully possible from creditors and maximize your discharge, in the event you have to file for bankruptcy.  Put another way, Pre-Bankruptcy planning is all about timing.  A good bankruptcy attorney will always consider the timing implications on when to file your petition.  The difference between a well-timed filing and an ill-timed filing is money in your pocket.  </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                  <img class='services-pg-icon' src='assets/img/icons/hand-scale-icon.png' /><h3>Loan Modification Assistance:</h3>\n\n                  <p>If you are struggling to pay your mortgage and are concerned you may be facing foreclosure, a loan modification program may be right for you.  A mortgage loan modification may help bring you up-to-date on your payments.  The process of modifying secured loans can be difficult and complicated to navigate on your own.  An attorney on your team during your secured loan application or the loan modification process will help you understand complex property law issues and also protect your financial future by advising against certain pitfalls, possible future issues, and predatory loan features. </p>\n                </div>\n\n\n                <div>\n                  <img class='services-pg-icon' src='assets/img/icons/scale-icon.png' /><h3>Debt Negotiation and Settlement:</h3>\n\n                  <p>Bankruptcy is not right for all people.  Bankruptcy is usually the last resort.  In some situations, however, it is possible to negotiate various debts down or structure a new payment plan that works for you.  A bankruptcy lawyer, fighting for you and looking out for your best interest, during debt negotiations can be a very valuable tool to help you level the playing field during debt negotiations and plan a pragmatic economic future.  </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                  <img class='services-pg-icon' src='assets/img/icons/courthouse.png' /><h3>Creditor Defense:</h3>\n\n                  <p>Sometimes a creditor goes after the wrong person, makes a mistake, or attempts to collect on a debt that is too old.  In those situations, when there is a strong defense against the debt, your best option oftentimes is to answer and defeat the claim of the creditor.  When you believe a creditor claim is fatally flawed, consultation with an attorney is advised to assess the viability of your defense, prepare your defense to challenge the creditor claim in a timely manner, and help resolve the issue for you.  </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                  <img class='services-pg-icon' src='assets/img/icons/creditcard.png' /><h3>Student Loan Advisory Services:</h3>\n\n                  <p>The law is an ever-moving target, especially Bankruptcy law and how student loans are viewed.  Depending on your situation, whether you have government or private student loans, and your personal socio-economic situation, there are often viable solutions for individuals drowning under excessive student loans and egregious monthly payments.  There is an old saying -- You don’t know what you don’t know until you know it.  With respect to excessive student loans, student loan advisory support with an attorney may open up various options you never knew existed.  </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                  <img class='services-pg-icon' src='assets/img/icons/money-shield.png' /><h3>Protection from Creditors:</h3>\n\n                  <p>Do you hate receiving calls from creditors and collection companies?

In other words, if you choose to file for bankruptcy, you must establish the optimal date to file the case to obtain the greatest relief in terms of the largest discharge with incurring the least risk of anything going wrong.  The fact of the matter is that bankruptcy law is nuanced and timing considerations are baked into and throughout the code.  Timing issues create pitfalls if you don’t know what to look out for.  It takes awareness of these timing issues and careful planning to increase the value and chance of success of any bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p>This article will address five timing considerations every bankruptcy petition preparer and filer should think about when deciding the appropriate date to file a case.</p>\n<h3 class=\"headlines main-bg\"><span class=\"bold\">1.) Tax Refund</span> -- Are you going to be receiving a tax refund this year?  If so, how much will the refund be?</h3>\n<div class=\"text-indent-div\">\n<p>In a standard Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, the “property of the estate” is established at the moment in time when your case is filed.  Property of the estate is a fancy way of describing all of the things you own or have a legal ownership stake in at that very specific moment in time when you filed the case.  In bankruptcy law, what is considered property of the estate is incredibly broad and property of the estate includes everything you know you own and even things that you don’t know you own.</p>\n<p>Usually, people who are filing for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy do not consider or realize that their annual Tax Refund is property of their estate.  However, the resourceful Trustee in your case knows that your Tax Refund is property of the estate because this is money that the government owes to you for the previous tax year.  This is why it is called a tax “refund.”  The issue is that if you file your case at the wrong time when this money is still owed to you, you will have to turn this tax refund money over to the Trustee to pay creditors upon receiving your tax money, if you want to obtain your discharge.</p>\n<p>For example, if you file your bankruptcy case on November 15, 2020 and your family routinely receives a tax refund, this is a problem.  In this hypothetical situation, the tax refund to be issued in 2021 is property of your estate and is not able to be protected or exempted under Arizona law.  In this case, you would need to expect the Trustee to ask you to hand over a large portion of your refund owed to you for the 2020 tax year before you would receive a discharge of debt.   So, what is the solution if you need to file bankruptcy and are expecting a sizable refund?</p>\n<p>The solution here is to be aware, have a plan, and be mindful of timing.  If your situation allows for it, the best way to handle a tax refund is to delay the filing of the case until your refund has been issued to your family and the refund is spent strategically on exempt assets.  This is considered pre-bankruptcy planning.  This strategy will allow your family to keep more assets even though you filed a bankruptcy case.  Working with a skilled bankruptcy lawyer on figuring out the best plan for you and your family with respect to tax refunds is a critical part of handling a bankruptcy case properly.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"headlines main-bg\"><span class=\"bold\"> 2.) Employment – </span> Are you unemployed presently?  Is your employment status changing in the near future? Are you starting a new job soon?</h3>\n<div class=\"text-indent-div\">\n<p>When deciding when is the right time for you to file your bankruptcy case, never forget the expression -- “You can’t get blood from a Turnip.”  In other words, your creditors can not get something from you, especially money, if you do not have it.</p>\n<p>Unsecured creditors cannot garnish employment wages if you are not employed.  Unsecured creditors cannot levy bank accounts if there is no money in the bank account to take.</p>\n<p>If you are dealing with unsecured creditors calling every day and harassing you, but you are unemployed, have no income otherwise, nothing in your bank account, and have nothing to pay the creditors, you may be making a mistake filing for bankruptcy too soon.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, the conventional wisdom is to wait until you have started new employment with steady income and then file for bankruptcy quickly before the creditors can garnish wages.  Under this strategy you are able to seek your maximum discharge and are able to keep a bankruptcy off of your record prior to landing another job.</p>\n<p>Not all employers care whether you file for bankruptcy or not, but some employers do care a lot.  Keeping options open when you are unemployed is very important and filing a bankruptcy case too early can pose some issues.  You obviously still risk being terminated by your employer upon filing the bankruptcy case as Arizona is an “at-will” employment State, but often employers are less concerned about this filing once you have begun work and established yourself as a valuable member of the team.   In fact, it can be explained to your employer that you are now more valuable to them with the case being filed because you will be far less stressed out with finances (assuming the bankruptcy discharge is ultimately ordered) and more focused on your job.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, exceptions to this general rule about delaying a filing until obtaining a new job.  These exceptions include if you are expecting to make a sizable annual wage on your next job, are facing immediate foreclosure, or if you own secured assets you want to keep that creditors can seize without the immediate protection of bankruptcy automatic stay.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"headlines main-bg\"><span class=\"bold\"> 3.) Income --  </span> Is your income built around seasonal income or a holiday bonus?</h3>\n<div class=\"text-indent-div\">\n<p>When determining if one qualifies for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy for purposes of median  income, the operative income time range to consider is the last six months of money earned.   In effect, this means that some people may qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy during a period of the year, but do not qualify for a Chapter 7 at other time ranges within the very same year due to irregular seasonal income.  This happens most frequently with people who have seasonal employment or obtain income from seasonal rental properties.</p>\n<p>If you mostly earn seasonal income, careful planning and considerations with respect to your prior earnings is REALLY important.  Careful assessment of income and timing when you file may be the difference between qualifying for a short-and-sweet Chapter 7 bankruptcy with a substantial discharge versus a three to five year Chapter 13 bankruptcy where you may pay many of your unsecured creditors back a portion of what is owed and a percentage to the Trustee over the life of the case.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"headlines main-bg\"><span class=\"bold\"> 4.) Insider Payments –   </span> Have you paid any loans off recently?  Have you paid back any family members or friends you own money to?</h3>\n<div class=\"text-indent-div\">\n<p>The bankruptcy code frowns on paying off certain creditors at the expense of other creditors.  This is known as a preferential payment or a payment to an insider.</p>\n<p>For example, if you owe a lot in credit card debt to the big banks and also owe credit card debt to your local credit union, but you only choose to pay your credit union back within 90 days prior to filing for bankruptcy, this will cause you problems in your case.  The laws do not allow you to pay one creditor back and seek discharge of debt in bankruptcy of the other creditors within 90 days without consequence.</p>\n<p>To avoid issues here, you must be considerate of when your last payments were made and possibly have to wait the appropriate amount of time to file the case.   Similarly, if you choose to pay family or friends back at the expense of creditors prior to filing your case, this also can create issues and must be considered with respect to the optimal time to file for bankruptcy.  Insider payments to family members are trickier to solve and can take some time, but these problems are necessary to plan for and work out in order to obtain a discharge of debt in a bankruptcy case.</p></div>\n\n<h3 class=\"headlines main-bg\"><span class=\"bold\"> 5.) Debts Owed to You –  </span> Does anyone owe you any money?  Do you have a claim against anyone else?</h3>\n<div class=\"text-indent-div\">\n<p>Nearly identical to the property of the estate logic contained within the tax refund issue described above, if you are owed money by anyone, you do not want to file a bankruptcy case until you are paid back, are assured you will not being getting paid back (i.e. the other party is a turnip), or you just cannot wait any longer to file your case for other reasons.</p>\n<p>On your bankruptcy petition, you will need to let the Court and the Trustee know if anyone owes money to you or if you have a legal claim against anyone else.  This money owed to you or your claim against another party is property of your estate and the Trustee will want that property.  If you file a case too early and have not actually collected on this money or pursued your claim fully, the Trustee will take your place and seek to collect your money to pay creditors.   This is why, sometimes, even though you may qualify for bankruptcy, it might be best to wait to file a case and to pursue the collections or claim you have against others first.</p>\n</div>\n\t<p>In conclusion, when you file a bankruptcy case involves a complex assessment of a number of variables.  Some cases certainly are less complex than others, but all cases deserve a careful and detailed analysis.  This is fundamentally why it is valuable to hire a lawyer to assist you with filing for bankruptcy.  The truth of the matter is -- you don’t know what you don’t know until you know it.  With bankruptcy, it is often too late once you learn your lesson and it is always advised to, at least, get a free consultation with a bankruptcy attorney if you are contemplating filing.</p><br /><br />\n\n<p class=\"bold pull-left\">See Next Blog Post - <Link exact to=\"/blog/posts/what-to-do-about-the-student-loan-crisis\"><a>\"What To Do About the Student Loan Crisis?\"</a></Link></p>\n\n<p class=\"bold pull-right\"><Link exact to=\"/blog\"><a>Back to Blog Posts Home</a></Link></p>\n\n            </div>\n\n\n          </div>\n\n        </div>\n        </div>\n        <Social />\n        <Form />\n      </div>\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default WhenShouldIFile\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport {\n  Route,\n  Link,\n  HashRouter\n} from 'react-router-dom'\nimport Form from '../../Form'\nimport Social from '../../Social'\n\nclass WhatToDoStudentLoans extends Component {\n\n  componentDidMount () {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n  }\n\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <div id='body'>\n<div class=\"blog-item-container\">\n        <div class='blog-pg-content-container'>\n          <div class='blog-pg-content'>\n\n            <div class=\"blog-post-list-item\">\n              <h2 class=\"headlines main-bg\">What To Do About The Student Loan Crisis?</h2>\n\n<p>By: Alex Coomer<br />\nNovember 28, 2020<br />\n<a href=\"www.alexcoomerlaw.com\">www.alexcoomerlaw.com</a><br />\n©Alex Coomer Law, PLLC, All Rights Reserved.</p>\n\n\t<p>The current dollar figures of consumer debt held by Americans are staggering.   Approximately 42 million people hold $1.6 Trillion in student loan debt<sup>1</sup>.  To compare, the country as a whole, 320 million + people, holds approximately $1 Trillion in credit card debt<sup>2</sup>.   To be clear -- both figures are substantial sums of cash borrowed by Americans and each form of debt creates unique problems for families to repay during an economic recession.  The major difference between these two forms of debt though is that there are many good options when credit card debt becomes overwhelming.  There are non-profit debt relief organizations that help with structuring affordable repayment plans, consolidation loans are available for some borrowers, and, most importantly, credit card debt is routinely discharged in bankruptcy when the debt becomes too great for an individual and their family.  In this way, people do see light at the end of the tunnel and there are relatively simplified legal means available for a fresh start due to credit card debt. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the vast majority of student loan holders never obtain any form of debt relief.  Instead, most student loan borrowers continue to struggle for life with repaying student loan debt, enduring painful wage garnishments, and the government taking your annual tax refund.  While student loan discharge in bankruptcy is legally possible under our current laws, discharge in bankruptcy remains exceedingly rare.  In fact, most people who file for bankruptcy and who hold student loan debt never even bother to seek student loan debt discharge during their case, even though it likely could be beneficial. <sup>3</sup> </p>\n\n\t<p>In order to solve this on-going student loan debt crisis, several politicians are presenting plans for student loan debt forgiveness.   Figures have been floated from between $10,000 to $50,000 worth of forgiveness, including up to 100% forgiveness of all student debt.  In light of the level of partisan politics in our country right now, it can be debated about the realistic chance of such debt forgiveness legislation passing.  This article is not about politics.  This article is about explaining why debt forgiveness is likely not the best solution to this pending problem in the first place and providing other, better, legislative options to pursue. </p>\n<p class=\"citations\"><sup>1 </sup><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/default.htm</a></p>\n<p class=\"citations\"><sup>2 </sup><a href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/cc/credit-card-debt-study/24400\" target=\"_blank\">https://wallethub.com/edu/cc/credit-card-debt-study/24400</a></p>\n<p class=\"citations\"><sup>3 </sup><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/student-loans-bankruptcy-133209637.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/student-loans-bankruptcy-133209637.html</a></p>\n\n\n<p>Why is student loan debt forgiveness a bad idea?  First, debt forgiveness is wrought with moral pitfalls<sup>4</sup>.  The biggest one of which is that debt forgiveness has serious potential to subsidize the rich and the privileged at the expense of the poor.  There are other fairness issues, including the fact that those who have higher earning jobs on the back end of school will likely have more debt and will enjoy a bigger windfall from student loan debt forgiveness than those who borrowed less and earn less.  In addition, debt forgiveness opens up the door to tax liability issues for those who theoretically enjoy substantial debt forgiveness<sup>5</sup>.  If our solution as a country is for people to trade one form of debt for another, albeit in a smaller amount, I’m disappointed in our politicians’ ability to problem solve.  Put another way, debt swapping simply is not a solution.  Moreover, massive debt forgiveness does not do anything to fix the future problem moving forward about the excessive cost of higher education and how future students will affordably finance education. Instead of an over-simplified debt forgiveness program, I proffer that there are a number of other ways, which all work together, that can address this issue holistically and do not have the same moral shortcomings as outright debt forgiveness. </p>\n\n<p>The first step is to forgive ALL accumulated Interest on Student Loans and peg all student loan borrowing at 0% moving forward.  Personally, this author is offended by the fact that the government is charging between 6.8%-7.8% on student loans when the rate of borrowing is presently so much cheaper for other forms of consumer debt.  The unfortunate reality is that a high interest rate on high dollar figures borrowed, like student loans, is why many consumers end up paying minimum payments for decades without actually knocking any of the original principal amount owed down.  It is a debt hole of death.  Even despite your best effort to make timely payments, the debt does not go down and can sometimes just keep getting bigger and bigger.   This sort of debt cycle must be stopped and addressed by Congress as consumers simply cannot and do not have the financial leverage to get themselves out on their own.  </p>\n\n<p>The obvious and easy solution here is to fix the interest rate on student loans to 0% and forgive all interest charges that have accumulated to date.  In other words, Congress should legislate forgiveness of just accumulated interest on student loans over the years and not forgive the student loan principal balance itself.  At the same time, any payments made to date by the borrower should retroactively apply to principal amounts borrowed and not to interest accumulation. Interest payments made by borrowers who already paid their student loans back in-full should be refunded.  The government has no reason to profit on the back of student loan borrowers or create a debt cycle that is impossible to emerge from.   From a purely academic tax-income perspective, forgiveness of interest accumulation is different from forgiveness of actual income received in the forms of dispersed student loans.  Therefore, any tax liability issues may be easily solved by clarifying any interest that is forgiven is not considered taxable income.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"citations\"><sup>4< /sup><a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-op-1124-goldberg-student-debt-20201123-e73254rlzbamffuqussj3rlwl4-story.html\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-op-1124-goldberg-student-debt-20201123-e73254rlzbamffuqussj3rlwl4-story.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"citations\"><sup>5 </sup><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/24/student-loan-forgiveness-may-come-with-tax-bomb-heres-what-you-should-know.html\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/24/student-loan-forgiveness-may-come-with-tax-bomb-heres-what-you-should-know.html </a></p>\n\n<p>Further, if interest rates are pegged at 0% moving forward for all student loan borrowing, there is much less complexity for borrowers to understand when calculating how long it will take to pay the loan back.  This article acknowledges that figuring out a solution to repay private student loan lenders and their interest on their loans is a separate issue entirely.  Fortunately, private student loan lenders only hold approximately 7.8% of all student loan debt. <sup>6</sup> </p>\n\n<p>The second step is that the Bankruptcy Code must be modified to make student loan discharge more viable.  This means a simplified code that relaxes the <i>Brunner</i><sup>7</sup> standard and creates a less burdensome procedure to accomplish student loan discharge.  Under the present system, in order to even argue for student loan discharge, one must file an “adversary proceeding”.  An adversary proceeding is separate and apart from the underlying bankruptcy case itself where you present evidence to a Bankruptcy Judge that a debtor satisfies the Brunner standard.  This is, in effect, another independent lawsuit that demands its own litigation within a Chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy case.  </p>\n\n<p>Not surprisingly, adversary proceedings are complex, time-consuming, and expensive for the borrower.  Adversary proceedings follow their own unique rules of procedure, different from standard civil lawsuits at your local Superior Court, and these cases usually require an attorney that specializes in this field of law.  In addition, adversary proceeding student loan discharge cases usually take several years or longer to complete.  This specialized expertise and serious time involved by the attorney, obviously, comes at a price to the borrower.  Due to these cost and time impediments, most people who file for bankruptcy never bother trying to seek student loan discharge or even know the option exists.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"citations\"><sup>6 </sup><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/student-loans/student-loan-debt#:~:text=Private%20student%20loans%20make%20up,student%20loan%20debt%3A%20%24131.81%20billion.\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/student-loans/student-loan-debt#:~:text=Private%20student%20loans%20make%20up,student%20loan%20debt%3A%20%24131.81%20billion.</a></p>\n<p class=\"citations\"><sup>7 </sup>The three prongs of the Brunner test require a showing: (1) that the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a minimal standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans; (2) that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans; and (3) the debtor made good faith efforts to repay the loans.  Brunner, 831 F.2d 395 at 396 (2nd. Cir. 1987).  </p>\n\n<p>Thus, this author believes there is a real synergy with a combination of interest forgiveness and bankruptcy reform to start fixing the student loan crisis.  The idea is simple at the core of it --  allow those with the means to pay the loan back to be able to actually pay the loan back due to 0% interest and at the same time still provide new streamlined forms of relief to those that simply must seek bankruptcy protection because the debt is far too substantial to repay.  Stay tuned on future blog posts for nitty-gritty suggestions on how to change the bankruptcy code to accommodate such a streamlined process.  </p>\n\n<p>And, finally, it has to be mentioned that society as a whole must address the ever-rising cost of higher education and be willing to increase the severity of penalties for predatory lending in the student loan system.  These final points are beyond the scope of this article, but these ideas deserve unique analysis as without addressing the root cause of unaffordable education, it is more than likely we will find ourselves back here again if we don’t also try to fix the fundamental issue of higher education costs. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, a major debt crisis with student loans is unfolding in front of our very eyes.  Unless addressed and solved holistically, this problem will not go away on its own.  It is time for Congress to act.  If action is not taken, the likely outcome is that families will suffer financially for decades, higher education will decline in availability, and the collective education of our country will go down.  While this author acknowledges there are multiple ways to go about solving this student loan issue, including the suggestions offered above, it is clear that a careful and long-term approach to fixing the student loan borrowing system is necessary to solve in order to strengthen the collective financial health of the country. </p>\n<br />\n\n<p class=\"bold pull-left\">See Previous Blog Post - <Link exact to=\"/blog/posts/when-should-I-file-for-bankruptcy\"><a>\"When Should I File For Bankruptcy?\"</a></Link></p>\n\n<p class=\"bold pull-right\"><Link exact to=\"/blog\"><a>Back to Blog Posts Home</a></Link></p>\n\n            </div>\n\n\n          </div>\n\n        </div>\n        </div>\n        <Social />\n        <Form />\n      </div>\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default WhatToDoStudentLoans\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport {\n  Route,\n  Link,\n  HashRouter\n} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport ServicesMenu from \"./ServicesMenu\";\nimport ServicesForm from \"../pages/ServicesForm\";\nimport Social from '../Social'\n\n\nimport { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';\nexport const history = createBrowserHistory();\n\n\n\n\nclass ChapterSeven extends Component {\n\n  constructor (props) {\n    super(props)\n\n\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount () {\n    const { fromServices } = this.props.location.state || {}\n    console.log(fromServices)\n    if (!fromServices) {\n      window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  render () {\n    var settings = {\n      dots: true,\n      centerMode: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      speed: 500,\n      slidesToShow: 1,\n      slidesToScroll: 1\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <div id='body'>\n\n        <div class='services-banner'>\n\n\n          <div class='services-hero'>\n            <h1>SERVICES</h1>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='services-pg-content-container '>\n          <div class='services-pg-div flex-col'>\n\n\n            <div class='flex-row services-pg-col-container'>\n              <div class='services-pg-col-1 flex-col'>\n                <div>\n                  <img class='services-pg-icon' src='assets/img/icons/contract-icon.png' /><h3>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition Preparation and Filing</h3>\n<h4>What is personal Chapter 7 Bankruptcy?</h4>\n                  <p>\n\nIn one relatively long sentence -  when an ordinary person’s debts become so unmanageable, their income cannot reasonably support their household expenses, and also pay back the debts, they can file for bankruptcy and the bankruptcy process helps manage the problem, ideally with the vast majority of unsecured debts being discharged.</p>\n\n<p>The most common form of bankruptcy is what is known as a Chapter 7 “no-asset” bankruptcy.  In a no-asset bankruptcy, the person filing for bankruptcy does not own valuable enough property in order for the bankruptcy Trustee to seize the property, sell the property, and pay creditors.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, in a no-asset case, a potential outcome is retention of property and a discharge of the vast majority of your unsecured debt.  Such an outcome of minimal property loss and maximum discharge of debt is the goal of a good bankruptcy attorney.  If such a goal cannot be achieved by filing for bankruptcy, there are other solutions available, such as debt negotiation, consolidation, or settlement.</p>\n\n<p>In some situations, an individual, by law, will not qualify as a no-asset bankruptcy either because they make too much money, own too many valuable things, or for other reasons.  In those cases, the job of the bankruptcy attorney is slightly different, but the end outcome should be the same -- to preserve as much property as possible lawfully and discharge as much debt as possible lawfully under the bankruptcy laws.</p>\n\n<p>For some people, it is legally impossible to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  For example, the bankruptcy code only allows a person to file for bankruptcy once every eight years.  If someone filed for bankruptcy five years ago and is in need of bankruptcy protection again, Chapter 13 may be the solution.  There are many other reasons why someone may need to file under Chapter 13, in addition to timing considerations.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, while the basic idea of bankruptcy is relatively straight forward, understanding and navigating the nuanced bankruptcy code is complex.  To fully understand the best strategies to protect you and your family from creditors, it is always wise to consider a consultation with a skilled bankruptcy attorney to discuss your personal situation.</p>\n\n\n<h4>If I file for Bankruptcy, can I keep my home?</h4>\n\n<p>Most of the time, yes.  All situations are unique and deserve independent analysis, however, whether you keep your home or not will depend mostly around how much you owe on the house and how much your house is worth.  The difference between what you owe on your house and what your house is worth is considered “equity” in the home.  </p>\n\n<p>Under Arizona law, if the equity in your home is $150,000 or less, proper usage and application of the “homestead exemption” in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case would provide an excellent avenue to protect your home.   Please note that you would still remain obligated to pay the mortgage on your house if you filed for Bankruptcy, but you certainly would not be forced to sell your house to pay unsecured creditors. </p>\n\n<p>If the equity in your home exceeds $150,000, this situation is more difficult to explain, and the outcomes can be varied, depending on your personal financial situation, your desire, and nature of the debts.  Do not worry if the equity in your home does exceed $150,000.  With the help of a skilled bankruptcy attorney, there are still ways to structure a personal bankruptcy in order to preserve your primary family home.  </p>\n\n<h4>What if my house is in the foreclosure process right now?</h4>\n\n<p>If your home is presently in foreclosure, it is critical that you contact an attorney right away. </p>\n\n<p>Let me repeat, if your house is presently in the foreclosure process, this is a big deal!  It is highly advised that you call an attorney who can take your call right away and assist.  </p>\n\n<p>With respect to stopping a foreclosure through bankruptcy and saving your house, this is possible, but timing and immediate action is of the utmost importance.   </p>\n\n<h4>Will I lose my retirement savings if I file for bankruptcy?</h4>\n\n<p>Almost all retirement accounts (401ks, IRAs, etc.) are considered “exempt” property.  Exempt property cannot be seized to pay creditors.  So, short answer -- no.  </p>\n\n<p>If you need to file for bankruptcy, it is your attorney’s job to help identify all exempt assets, similar to retirement accounts, and disclose these assets appropriately to the Bankruptcy Court and Trustee in your Petition filings to properly protect your exempt property from creditors.  </p>\n\n<h4>Will I lose my car if I file for Bankruptcy?</h4>\n\n<p>Maybe -- it depends on many factors.   For instance, how much is your car worth?  How much do you owe?  Are you married? Do you have any other vehicles that are fully paid off or nearly paid off? If so, how much are those vehicles worth?  Do you want to keep this particular car or would you be happy to get rid of the car to the lender for whatever reason?  Do you have multiple loans on the vehicle?  </p>\n\n<p>In the event of financial problems, it is the job of your bankruptcy attorney to help you establish the best strategy for you, your family, and your given situation with respect to car ownership, the law, and life.</p>\n\n<h4>What is secured and unsecured debt?</h4>\n\n<p>The distinction between secured and unsecured debt is critical. The bankruptcy code treats secured debt differently than unsecured debt.  </p>\n\n<p>Put simply, secured debt are types of loans that are actually backed or secured by something, usually the item you bought with the loan.  The most common examples of secured debt are home mortgages and car loans.  In most cases, secured debt cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.  There are, however, exceptions to secondary mortgages and secondary car loans, that can be discharged in bankruptcy under certain circumstances.  </p>\n\n<p>Unsecured debt are loans or credit lines that are based on your personal guarantee.  These are debts not secured by real estate or the purchased item.  These consumer debts commonly include credit card debt, medical debt, past-due rent, and all other debts driven by your guarantee to pay.  Unsecured debts, depending on your income and assets, are the most likely form of debt to be discharged in bankruptcy.  </p>\n\n<p>A bankruptcy lawyer helps properly identify all of your debts, establish what is legally dischargeable, what is not dischargeable, and come up with the best plan for you.  In some cases, in consultation with an attorney, pre-bankruptcy planning is extremely helpful in order to maximize the amount of discharge.  </p>\n\n<h4>What about student loans?   </h4>\n\n<p>Even though a student loan may seem like an unsecured loan because it is not secured by anything other than your promise to pay, the bankruptcy code treats student loans differently than other unsecured debt. Unfortunately, the current state of bankruptcy law as applied to student loans is not favorable to borrowers.  Most student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  There are limited exceptions, but, in general, it is very difficult to get student loans discharged through bankruptcy.  </p>\n\n<p>If you are behind on student loans, there are other options besides bankruptcy, such as loan consolidation, forbearance on payments due to economic hardship, or applying to be placed into affordable income based repayment plans for Federal student loans.   </p>\n\n<h4>Will a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy stop wage garnishments? </h4>\n\n<p>Yes, in most situations.  Once you file for bankruptcy, an “automatic stay” will be put in place on all collection efforts by your creditors.  This includes wage garnishments.   In certain circumstances, it is possible to recover past wage garnishments that have already been seized by creditors through the bankruptcy process.</p>\n\n<p>If your wages are being garnished presently, or your creditors are threatening to garnish your wages, and you are worried, please consider contacting a bankruptcy attorney who can help you right away.</p>\n\n<h4>How long will the whole Bankruptcy process take?</h4>\n\n<p>This depends on the type of bankruptcy you file, how quickly you acquire all the necessary documentation, how backed up the bankruptcy courts are due to COVID precautions, and a number of other factors.</p>\n\n<p>Expect at least four to six months from start to finish for most Chapter 7 bankruptcies. </p>\n\n<p>Under a very fast scenario, without any delays whatsoever, from start to finish on a Chapter 7 no-asset case, could be completed in as little as four to six weeks. </p>\n\n<p>Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings are long and slow.  Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings can last between three and five years, sometimes longer.  </p>\n\n<h4>What exactly is a Trustee?  </h4>\n\n<p>When a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy Petition is filed, a Trustee will be appointed to the case by the Bankruptcy Court.  </p>\n\n<p>In a Chapter 7, the Trustee’s job is to assess the Bankruptcy Petition and establish if it is a no-asset bankruptcy or if there are assets that need to be seized.  If there are no assets, the Trustee’s job is fairly straightforward and the case will likely be finished within a matter of weeks. </p>\n\n<p>If there are assets to be sold, the Trustee’s job is to acquire the assets, sell them (“liquidation”), and distribute the proceeds to creditors in accordance with bankruptcy law. Unfortunately, the timeline on this process is uncertain as it takes the Trustee an uncertain amount of time to complete the job. </p>\n\n<p>In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the Trustee’s job is far more complex and the role of the Trustee will depend greatly on the specific situation of the person filing for bankruptcy and the creditors.  </p>\n\n<h4>What if I have a lot of personal property?  Why can’t I give my property to a friend or family member?</h4>\n\n<p>It is a very bad idea to transfer any property or interests in real estate to family members or friends if you are contemplating bankruptcy.  In some cases, such behavior can result in your potential bankruptcy case being dismissed and will delay any future bankruptcy filing for a period of years.  In other more serious cases, such behavior can result in possible criminal bankruptcy fraud charges. </p>\n\n<p>It is the job of the resourceful Trustee, appointed by the Bankruptcy Court, to verify that non-exempt assets that could have been used to pay creditors were not illegally transferred, sold, or moved prior to filing for bankruptcy. </p>\n\n<p>Bankruptcy is a process for the honest debtor.  Bankruptcy is not a process designed to hide, scam, cheat, or defraud your creditors. (Emphasis added).  </p>\n\n<p>If you have moved or transferred property and are now nervous, there are potential solutions that a bankruptcy attorney can suggest.  It is not the end of the world if you think you made a mistake with respect to the transfer of property because a good bankruptcy attorney can help you navigate the process back. </p>\n\n<h4>I’ve talked to several bankruptcy attorneys, but I do not know who I should hire.  Should I just hire the attorney who quoted me the cheapest fee?  Are bankruptcy attorneys all the same?  </h4>\n\n<p>Cost is obviously a major factor when it comes to your decision as to who to hire as your attorney, but it is not the only thing to consider.  </p>\n\n<p>Every attorney is different. Consider the big picture.  Going through a personal debt crisis, business failure, or bankruptcy will be emotionally difficult for most people and, for some especially, it is critically important to have a lawyer who you connect with personally, who listens to you intently at all times, and who you know has your back. </p>  \n\n<p>If you find it difficult to get in touch or garnish the attention of your attorney, this is a red flag and likely someone you do not want to work with.   You are NOT a number.   Please be wary of “bankruptcy mills” in Tucson and Southern Arizona.  Bankruptcy mills work and operate on volume.  A volume business model makes it difficult for you to obtain the personal relationship you should have with your attorney.  </p>\n\n<p>Finally, the bankruptcy process is not particularly fast.  You will be working closely with your bankruptcy lawyer during the preparation of the bankruptcy petition for several months, maybe longer. </p>  \n\n<p>For these practical reasons, you want to hire a lawyer you like.  You want a lawyer you want to work with during this trying process.  Debt resolution, loan modifications, and bankruptcy are difficult things to go through.  To make sure the process is as painless as possible for you, it is important to have a true and genuine relationship with your attorney.  </p>\n\n<p>Put simply -- don’t be fooled by the lowest cost attorney.  There is more to the equation in assessing who is the right attorney for you.  </p> \n\n\n                </div>\n\n\n\n              </div>\n\n              <div class=\"services-pg-col-2\">\n\n<ServicesMenu>\n</ServicesMenu>\n\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <Social />\n        <ServicesForm />\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ChapterSeven\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport {\n  Route,\n  Link,\n  HashRouter\n} from 'react-router-dom'\nimport ServicesMenu from \"./ServicesMenu\";\nimport ServicesForm from \"../pages/ServicesForm\";\nimport Social from '../Social'\n\n\n\nclass ChapterThirteen extends Component {\n\n\n  constructor (props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = ({\n      fromServices:false\n    })\n\n  }\n  componentDidMount () {\n    const { fromServices } = this.props.location.state || {}\n    console.log(fromServices)\n    if (!fromServices) {\n      window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n  render () {\n    var settings = {\n      dots: true,\n      centerMode: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      speed: 500,\n      slidesToShow: 1,\n      slidesToScroll: 1\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <div id='body'>\n\n        <div class='services-banner'>\n\n\n          <div class='services-hero'>\n            <h1>SERVICES</h1>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='services-pg-content-container '>\n          <div class='services-pg-div flex-col'>\n\n\n            <div class='flex-row services-pg-col-container'>\n              <div class='services-pg-col-1 flex-col'>\n\n\n                <div>\n                  <img class='services-pg-icon' src='assets/img/icons/moneyscale.png' /><h3>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Petition Preparation and Filing:</h3>\n\n                  <h4>What is Chapter 13 Bankruptcy?</h4>\n\n<p>By far, most people who run into financial hot-water ultimately file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7.  In some cases, however, an individual cannot file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy for legal reasons or it may be more advantageous to file under Chapter 13. </p>\n\n<p>The most common situations where someone may file for Chapter 13 is when you make too much money, you have too much equity in your property, you have filed for Chapter 7 too recently, most of your debt is not dischargeable under the bankruptcy code, or you have specific secured debts you would like to address.  </p>\n\n<p>In very limited detail, a Chapter 13 takes the following steps.  First, an individual with a regular source of income first proposes a plan of repayment.  Second, you obtain court approval of the plan.  Third, you make the plan payments over a number of years.  Generally speaking, the Chapter 13 plan is prepared by your attorney before the Petition is filed.  The length of a Chapter 13 plan is between three and five years.  </p>\n\n<p>A Trustee in a Chapter 13 has the responsibility of reviewing the plan before the Court approves the plan.  The Trustee makes the determination of whether the plan is feasible, whether you will be able to make the payments you propose under the plan, and whether the plan meets the legal requirements for Court approval.  After obtaining Court approval, you must execute and follow through with the plan.  </p>\n\n<h4>Who might a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy apply to? </h4>\n\n<p>If your income is substantial.  In Arizona, there is an economic test called the “means test” that determines if your income is more than the basic living expense.  Chapter 13 may apply to you if your household income exceeds the basic living expense and there is no other way to qualify you for a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.  </p>\n\n<p>If your property is worth more than the exemptions or is not exempt.  In other words, you have nice things.   You can keep your property in this case, but you will need to plan to pay your creditors the non-exempt portion to keep your property.</p>\n\n<p>If you have significant equity in your house and vehicle, want to keep your house and vehicle, but are not current on your debts payments.  It is possible to pay the arrears, keep payments current, and pay your house and vehicle debts during Chapter 13.  </p>\n\n<p>If you owe significant back taxes or child support.  Some debt, like most tax debt and child support, is not dischargeable.  If you are behind, It is possible to pay arrears on child support or tax creditors in Chapter 13 and establish a new payment plan that accurately suits your financial situation.  </p>\n\n\n<h4>How is a Chapter 13 different from a Chapter 7? </h4>\n\n<p>In a Chapter 7, you will surrender non-exempt assets that are sold for the benefit of creditors. In a Chapter 13, you will commit part of your future income, along with other assets you have committed to the plan, to be distributed to creditors. </p>\n\n<p>In a Chapter 7, you have very limited ability to change the nature of a debt by a secured creditor when the debt is in default and the creditor does not want to make a deal.  In a Chapter 13, you have the right to cure defaults over a period of time, even over the secured creditor’s objection.</p>\n\n<p>In a Chapter 7, obtaining a discharge usually takes about four to six months.  In a Chapter 13, obtaining a discharge (if there is a discharge available), will take between three and five years.  </p>\n\n<p>In a Chapter 7, the Bankruptcy Code determines what is distributed and to whom.  In a Chapter 13, the plan itself establishes how much and when creditors are to be paid.  </p>\n\n<h4>I’ve heard Chapter 13 Bankruptcies are hard to complete, is this true? </h4>\n\n<p>Yes, the fact of the matter is that most individuals who enter into a Chapter 13 plan are not successful. </p>\n\n<p>To succeed under a Chapter 13 plan, you have to have discipline and be willing to endure significant life-style changes.  Completion of a Chapter 13 plan is not impossible though and many individuals have achieved financial goals through execution of a Chapter 13.  With extra attention to details, finding extra cost savings in your day-to-day life, and enduring a little financial pain, Chapter 13 can be an excellent solution for certain individuals. </p>\n\n\n</div>\n              </div>\n\n              <div class=\"services-pg-col-2\">\n\n              <ServicesMenu>\n              </ServicesMenu>\n\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <Social />\n        <ServicesForm />\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ChapterThirteen\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport {\n  Route,\n  Link,\n  HashRouter\n} from 'react-router-dom'\nimport ServicesMenu from \"./ServicesMenu\";\nimport ServicesForm from \"../pages/ServicesForm\";\nimport Social from '../Social'\n\n\n\nclass CreditorDefense extends Component {\n\n  componentDidMount () {\n    const { fromServices } = this.props.location.state || {}\n    console.log(fromServices)\n    if (!fromServices) {\n      window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n  render () {\n    var settings = {\n      dots: true,\n      centerMode: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      speed: 500,\n      slidesToShow: 1,\n      slidesToScroll: 1\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <div id='body'>\n\n        <div class='services-banner'>\n\n\n          <div class='services-hero'>\n            <h1>SERVICES</h1>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='services-pg-content-container '>\n          <div class='services-pg-div flex-col'>\n\n\n            <div class='flex-row services-pg-col-container'>\n              <div class='services-pg-col-1 flex-col'>\n\n                <div>\n                  <img class='services-pg-icon' src='assets/img/icons/courthouse.png' /><h3>Creditor Defense:</h3>\n\n                  <p>Sometimes a creditor goes after the wrong person, makes a mistake, or attempts to collect on a debt that is too old.  In those situations, when there is a strong defense against the debt, your best option oftentimes is to answer and defeat the claim of the creditor.  When you believe a creditor claim is fatally flawed, consultation with an attorney is advised to assess the viability of your defense, prepare your defense to challenge the creditor claim in a timely manner, and help resolve the issue for you.</p>\n\n                  <h4>What does it mean for debt to be too old?</h4>\n\n<p>Debt being “too old” is a way to talk about the Statute of Limitations to bring a breach of contract lawsuit against you.  Put another way, debt is “too old” if the time has passed for the creditor to bring a valid legal claim.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, in Arizona, a verbal contract or “open account” has a Statute of Limitation of three years from when the cause of action occurred.  The most common “open account” that people encounter in day-to-day life is emergency room medical debt. </p>\n\n<p>ARS § 12-543 (oral contracts) → <a href=\"https://www.azleg.gov/ars/12/00543.htm\" target=\"blank\">https://www.azleg.gov/ars/12/00543.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>A written contract in Arizona maintains a Statute of Limitation of six years from when the cause of action occurred.  This includes credit card debt.  Credit card debt that has been sold onto many collection firms for a number of years, after the card went into default for several years, is an example of when debt may become too old to bring a valid lawsuit against you.  </p>\n\n<p>ARS § 12-548 (written contracts) → <a href=\"https://www.azleg.gov/ars/12/00548.htm\" target=\"blank\">https://www.azleg.gov/ars/12/00548.htm</a> </p>\n\n<p>Please Note --  It is necessary to consult with a licenced attorney when calculating the Statute of Limitations of any given claim or cause of action.  While the basics on the surface seem simple, there are also complex, nuanced, and detailed aspects of calculating Statutes of Limitations for every specific case that only an attorney can fully assess. </p>\n\n<h4>What other possible defenses to debt lawsuits are there?</h4>\n\n<p>In some rare cases, you can challenge whether you were served with legal documents correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Service of Process Rule 4.1 of the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://govt.westlaw.com/azrules/Document/N96ABD6F086DC11E699A4BB097EBD55F8?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&bhcp=1\" target=\"_blank\">https://govt.westlaw.com/azrules/Document/N96ABD6F086DC11E699A4BB097EBD55F8?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&bhcp=1</a></p>\n\n<p>On occasion, you may also be able to challenge whether a debt-buying firm actually has the proper paperwork and legal “standing” to sue you.  You must answer and respond to the creditors lawsuit if you think this defense applies to you.</p>\n\n<p>Another example of valid debt defense is when you are sued by a credit card company after being the victim of criminal identity theft or fraud.  In such situations, you do NOT want to admit responsibility to these charges and must present a timely defense with evidence in Court that you never authorized the charges.</p>\n\n                </div>\n\n              </div>\n\n              <div class=\"services-pg-col-2\">\n\n              <ServicesMenu>\n              </ServicesMenu>\n\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <Social />\n        <ServicesForm />\n\n\n\n      </div>\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default CreditorDefense\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport {\n  Route,\n  Link,\n  HashRouter\n} from 'react-router-dom'\nimport ServicesMenu from \"./ServicesMenu\";\nimport ServicesForm from \"../pages/ServicesForm\";\nimport Social from '../Social'\n\n\n\nclass DebtNegotiation extends Component {\n\n  componentDidMount () {\n    const { fromServices } = this.props.location.state || {}\n    console.log(fromServices)\n    if (!fromServices) {\n      window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  render () {\n    var settings = {\n      dots: true,\n      centerMode: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      speed: 500,\n      slidesToShow: 1,\n      slidesToScroll: 1\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <div id='body'>\n\n        <div class='services-banner'>\n\n\n          <div class='services-hero'>\n            <h1>SERVICES</h1>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='services-pg-content-container '>\n          <div class='services-pg-div flex-col'>\n\n\n            <div class='flex-row services-pg-col-container'>\n              <div class='services-pg-col-1 flex-col'>\n\n                <div>\n                  <img class='services-pg-icon' src='assets/img/icons/scale-icon.png' /><h3>Debt Negotiation and Settlement:</h3>\n\n                  <p>Bankruptcy is not right for all people.

Pre-Bankruptcy planning and assistance helps you understand your financial situation in order to have a plan in place to protect as much property as lawfully possible from creditors and maximize your discharge, in the event you have to file for bankruptcy.</p>\n\n                  <h4>Can you please explain pre-bankruptcy planning in more detail and why this service is valuable to me?</h4>\n\n<p>In a Chapter 7 case, a thoughtful bankruptcy lawyer must analyze the timing of filing your case to maximize your exemptions and minimize the assets that will be liquidated or taken from you to pay your creditors.   In other words, good pre-bankruptcy planning protects your stuff, gets you the largest legal discharge available, and provides the best foundation possible for your life coming out of bankruptcy.</p>\n\n<p>For example, without proper pre-bankruptcy planning and assistance from an attorney, it is possible you may surrender most (if not all) of your tax refund.  An ill-timed filing at the end of the calendar year when you are anticipating a big refund will likely result in the Trustee keeping your case open until your refund arrives and taking your refund to pay creditors a portion of the debt owed.  If you regularly receive a large tax refund, discussion with an attorney as to the optimal time to file and how to spend your tax refund properly prior to filing is highly advised.</p>\n\n<p>Another classic example where proper pre-bankruptcy planning with an attorney is helpful is when you have way too much equity in automobiles, own lots of vehicles, and you must transition non-exempt assets into exempt assets prior to filing.   With the guidance of an attorney, you can sell the vehicles you do not want to keep and with the sale proceeds of the vehicles know exactly what you can buy, how much you can spend, and the timing of this process to accumulate helpful exempt assets to your family (i.e. stuff you get to keep even though you are filing for bankruptcy). </p>\n\n<h4>Won’t Pre-Bankruptcy Planning slow down my filing? </h4>\n\n<p>Yes, in theory, your filing date can be pushed back in order to Pre-Bankruptcy plan properly. BUT, this sort of pre-bankruptcy strategy will only be done to maximize value in your case for you as applied to your given situation. </p> \n\n<p>In some cases, such as a pending home foreclosure or where there are heavy wage garnishments already in place, there may not be any incentive or financial reasons to pre-bankruptcy plan to the same degree and filing your case quickly will be the priority. </p>\n\n<h4>Is Pre-Bankruptcy Planning expensive?  </h4>\n\n<p>No, in fact, there is usually no separate charge for pre-bankruptcy planning.  At Alex Coomer Law, Pre-Bankruptcy planning is typically built into the flat fee price designed for your case and your situation.  Pre-Bankruptcy planning is simply good legal work. </p>\n\n                </div>\n\n              </div>\n\n              <div class=\"services-pg-col-2\">\n\n              <ServicesMenu>\n              </ServicesMenu>\n\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n<Social />\n<ServicesForm />\n\n      </div>\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default PreBankruptcy\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport {\n  Route,\n  Link,\n  HashRouter\n} from 'react-router-dom'\nimport ServicesMenu from \"./ServicesMenu\";\nimport ServicesForm from \"../pages/ServicesForm\";\nimport Social from '../Social'\n\n\n\nclass ProtectionFrom extends Component {\n\n  componentDidMount () {\n    const { fromServices } = this.props.location.state || {}\n    console.log(fromServices)\n    if (!fromServices) {\n      window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  render () {\n    var settings = {\n      dots: true,\n      centerMode: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      speed: 500,\n      slidesToShow: 1,\n      slidesToScroll: 1\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <div id='body'>\n\n        <div class='services-banner'>\n\n\n          <div class='services-hero'>\n            <h1>SERVICES</h1>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='services-pg-content-container '>\n          <div class='services-pg-div flex-col'>\n\n\n            <div class='flex-row services-pg-col-container'>\n              <div class='services-pg-col-1 flex-col'>\n\n\n              <div>\n                <img class='services-pg-icon' src='assets/img/icons/money-shield.png' /><h3>Protection from Creditors:</h3>\n\n                <p>Do you hate receiving calls from creditors and collection companies?

Depending on your situation, whether you have government or private student loans, and your personal socio-economic situation, there are often viable solutions for individuals drowning under excessive student loans and egregious monthly payments. There is an old saying -- You don’t know what you don’t know until you know it. With respect to excessive student loans, student loan advisory support with an attorney may open up various options you never knew existed.</p>\n\n                <h4>I’m drowning in Student Loan debt.  Can you explain in a little more detail about the student loan discharge process in bankruptcy?</h4>\n\n<p>Unless and until the Federal Government acts on comprehensive Student Loan Reform and related Bankruptcy reform, the current state of the law presents a number of barriers to obtaining an easy, quick, or clean discharge of student loan debt in bankruptcy.</p>\n\n<p>This does NOT mean it is impossible to obtain a discharge, however, it is a trying and slow process that entails a number of procedural tasks and legal elements that must be satisfied.</p>\n\n<p>The general state of the law is codified under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8).  This section of the bankruptcy code provides that student loans are excepted from the discharge a debtor receives in bankruptcy unless repaying those loans would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor’s dependents.</p>\n\n<p>In United Student Aid Funds v. Pena (In re Pena), 155 F.3d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir. 1998), the Ninth Circuit adopted the three-pronged test set out in Brunner, 831 F.2d 395 at 396 (2nd. Cir. 1987), to determine whether the undue hardship standard has been met for a particular debtor in a particular situation.</p>\n\n<p>The three prongs require a showing: (1) that the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a minimal standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans; (2) that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans; and (3) the debtor made good faith efforts to repay the loans.</p>\n\n<p>If your factual situation meets the basic elements of the Brunner Test and you desire to begin the long and arduous process to have your student loans discharged, you must file an Adversary Proceeding and related Complaint to Determine Dischargeability.  This Adversary Proceeding and Complaint to Determine Dischargeability is separate from your Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Petition.</p>\n\n<p>After the Bankruptcy Petition and related Adversary Proceeding is filed and pre-trial proceedings (including discovery) are conducted, a trial will eventually be held in front of a Bankruptcy Judge.  The Bankruptcy Judge will hear testimony and weigh evidence on whether your particular situation meets the Brunner factors.  Just like any trial, the opposing party(ies), the Student loan Issuer and Servicer, will be represented by an attorney and will be presented an opportunity to offer evidence in support of their case that the loans should not be discharged.</p>\n\n<p>After hearing the facts of the case and applying the facts to the state of the law, the Bankruptcy Judge then possesses the power to order your student loans discharged or not.  The whole process takes several years to complete, but may be worth it if your loans are large enough, your personal situation satisfies the Brunner factors, and significant financial relief can be obtained for you.</p>\n\n<h4>How much will it cost to hire a lawyer to help me with this process?</h4>\n\n<p>There is no one fixed rate or fee for services with Alex Coomer Law.

In a no-asset bankruptcy, the person filing for bankruptcy does not own valuable enough property in order for the bankruptcy Trustee to seize the property, sell the property, and pay creditors.</p>\n\n                  <p>In other words, in a no-asset case, a potential outcome is retention of property and a discharge of the vast majority of your unsecured debt.  Such an outcome of minimal property loss and maximum discharge of debt is the goal of a good bankruptcy attorney.  If such a goal cannot be achieved by filing for bankruptcy, there are other solutions available, such as debt negotiation, consolidation, or settlement.</p>\n\n                  <p>In some situations, an individual, by law, will not qualify as a no-asset bankruptcy either because they make too much money, own too many valuable things, or for other reasons.  In those cases, the job of the bankruptcy attorney is slightly different, but the end outcome should be the same -- to preserve as much property as possible lawfully and discharge as much debt as possible lawfully under the bankruptcy laws.</p>\n\n                  <p>For some people, it is legally impossible to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  For example, the bankruptcy code only allows a person to file for bankruptcy once every eight years.  If someone filed for bankruptcy five years ago and is in need of bankruptcy protection again, Chapter 13 may be the solution.  There are many other reasons why someone may need to file under Chapter 13, in addition to timing considerations.</p>\n\n                  <p>In conclusion, while the basic idea of bankruptcy is relatively straight forward, understanding and navigating the nuanced bankruptcy code is complex.  To fully understand the best strategies to protect you and your family from creditors, it is always wise to consider a consultation with a skilled bankruptcy attorney to discuss your personal situation.</p>\n\n\n                  <h4>If I file for Bankruptcy, can I keep my home?</h4>\n\n                  <p>Most of the time, yes.  All situations are unique and deserve independent analysis, however, whether you keep your home or not will depend mostly around how much you owe on the house and how much your house is worth.  The difference between what you owe on your house and what your house is worth is considered “equity” in the home.  </p>\n\n                  <p>Under Arizona law, if the equity in your home is $150,000 or less, proper usage and application of the “homestead exemption” in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case would provide an excellent avenue to protect your home.   Please note that you would still remain obligated to pay the mortgage on your house if you filed for Bankruptcy, but you certainly would not be forced to sell your house to pay unsecured creditors. </p>\n\n                  <p>If the equity in your home exceeds $150,000, this situation is more difficult to explain, and the outcomes can be varied, depending on your personal financial situation, your desire, and nature of the debts.  Do not worry if the equity in your home does exceed $150,000.  With the help of a skilled bankruptcy attorney, there are still ways to structure a personal bankruptcy in order to preserve your primary family home.  </p>\n\n                  <h4>What if my house is in the foreclosure process right now?</h4>\n\n                  <p>If your home is presently in foreclosure, it is critical that you contact an attorney right away. </p>\n\n                  <p>Let me repeat, if your house is presently in the foreclosure process, this is a big deal!  It is highly advised that you call an attorney who can take your call right away and assist.  </p>\n\n                  <p>With respect to stopping a foreclosure through bankruptcy and saving your house, this is possible, but timing and immediate action is of the utmost importance.   </p>\n\n                  <h4>Will I lose my retirement savings if I file for bankruptcy?</h4>\n\n                  <p>Almost all retirement accounts (401ks, IRAs, etc.) are considered “exempt” property.  Exempt property cannot be seized to pay creditors.  So, short answer -- no.  </p>\n\n                  <p>If you need to file for bankruptcy, it is your attorney’s job to help identify all exempt assets, similar to retirement accounts, and disclose these assets appropriately to the Bankruptcy Court and Trustee in your Petition filings to properly protect your exempt property from creditors.  </p>\n\n                  <h4>Will I lose my car if I file for Bankruptcy?</h4>\n\n                  <p>Maybe -- it depends on many factors.   For instance, how much is your car worth?  How much do you owe?  Are you married? Do you have any other vehicles that are fully paid off or nearly paid off? If so, how much are those vehicles worth?  Do you want to keep this particular car or would you be happy to get rid of the car to the lender for whatever reason?  Do you have multiple loans on the vehicle?  </p>\n\n                  <p>In the event of financial problems, it is the job of your bankruptcy attorney to help you establish the best strategy for you, your family, and your given situation with respect to car ownership, the law, and life.</p>\n\n                  <h4>What is secured and unsecured debt?</h4>\n\n                  <p>The distinction between secured and unsecured debt is critical. The bankruptcy code treats secured debt differently than unsecured debt.  </p>\n\n                  <p>Put simply, secured debt are types of loans that are actually backed or secured by something, usually the item you bought with the loan.  The most common examples of secured debt are home mortgages and car loans.  In most cases, secured debt cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.  There are, however, exceptions to secondary mortgages and secondary car loans, that can be discharged in bankruptcy under certain circumstances.  </p>\n\n                  <p>Unsecured debt are loans or credit lines that are based on your personal guarantee.  These are debts not secured by real estate or the purchased item.  These consumer debts commonly include credit card debt, medical debt, past-due rent, and all other debts driven by your guarantee to pay.  Unsecured debts, depending on your income and assets, are the most likely form of debt to be discharged in bankruptcy.  </p>\n\n                  <p>A bankruptcy lawyer helps properly identify all of your debts, establish what is legally dischargeable, what is not dischargeable, and come up with the best plan for you.  In some cases, in consultation with an attorney, pre-bankruptcy planning is extremely helpful in order to maximize the amount of discharge.  </p>\n\n                  <h4>What about student loans?   </h4>\n\n                  <p>Even though a student loan may seem like an unsecured loan because it is not secured by anything other than your promise to pay, the bankruptcy code treats student loans differently than other unsecured debt. Unfortunately, the current state of bankruptcy law as applied to student loans is not favorable to borrowers.  Most student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  There are limited exceptions, but, in general, it is very difficult to get student loans discharged through bankruptcy.  </p>\n\n                  <p>If you are behind on student loans, there are other options besides bankruptcy, such as loan consolidation, forbearance on payments due to economic hardship, or applying to be placed into affordable income based repayment plans for Federal student loans.   </p>\n\n                  <h4>Will a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy stop wage garnishments? </h4>\n\n                  <p>Yes, in most situations.  Once you file for bankruptcy, an “automatic stay” will be put in place on all collection efforts by your creditors.  This includes wage garnishments.   In certain circumstances, it is possible to recover past wage garnishments that have already been seized by creditors through the bankruptcy process.</p>\n\n                  <p>If your wages are being garnished presently, or your creditors are threatening to garnish your wages, and you are worried, please consider contacting a bankruptcy attorney who can help you right away.</p>\n\n                  <h4>How long will the whole Bankruptcy process take?</h4>\n\n                  <p>This depends on the type of bankruptcy you file, how quickly you acquire all the necessary documentation, how backed up the bankruptcy courts are due to COVID precautions, and a number of other factors.</p>\n\n                  <p>Expect at least four to six months from start to finish for most Chapter 7 bankruptcies. </p>\n\n                  <p>Under a very fast scenario, without any delays whatsoever, from start to finish on a Chapter 7 no-asset case, could be completed in as little as four to six weeks. </p>\n\n                  <p>Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings are long and slow.  Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings can last between three and five years, sometimes longer.  </p>\n\n                  <h4>What exactly is a Trustee?  </h4>\n\n                  <p>When a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy Petition is filed, a Trustee will be appointed to the case by the Bankruptcy Court.  </p>\n\n                  <p>In a Chapter 7, the Trustee’s job is to assess the Bankruptcy Petition and establish if it is a no-asset bankruptcy or if there are assets that need to be seized.  If there are no assets, the Trustee’s job is fairly straightforward and the case will likely be finished within a matter of weeks. </p>\n\n                  <p>If there are assets to be sold, the Trustee’s job is to acquire the assets, sell them (“liquidation”), and distribute the proceeds to creditors in accordance with bankruptcy law. Unfortunately, the timeline on this process is uncertain as it takes the Trustee an uncertain amount of time to complete the job. </p>\n\n                  <p>In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the Trustee’s job is far more complex and the role of the Trustee will depend greatly on the specific situation of the person filing for bankruptcy and the creditors.  </p>\n\n                  <h4>What if I have a lot of personal property?  Why can’t I give my property to a friend or family member?</h4>\n\n                  <p>It is a very bad idea to transfer any property or interests in real estate to family members or friends if you are contemplating bankruptcy.  In some cases, such behavior can result in your potential bankruptcy case being dismissed and will delay any future bankruptcy filing for a period of years.  In other more serious cases, such behavior can result in possible criminal bankruptcy fraud charges. </p>\n\n                  <p>It is the job of the resourceful Trustee, appointed by the Bankruptcy Court, to verify that non-exempt assets that could have been used to pay creditors were not illegally transferred, sold, or moved prior to filing for bankruptcy. </p>\n\n                  <p>Bankruptcy is a process for the honest debtor.  Bankruptcy is not a process designed to hide, scam, cheat, or defraud your creditors. (Emphasis added).  </p>\n\n                  <p>If you have moved or transferred property and are now nervous, there are potential solutions that a bankruptcy attorney can suggest.  It is not the end of the world if you think you made a mistake with respect to the transfer of property because a good bankruptcy attorney can help you navigate the process back. </p>\n                </div>\n\n\n\n              </div>\n\n              <div class=\"services-pg-col-2\">\n\n<BankruptcyMenu>\n</BankruptcyMenu>\n\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n<Social />\n        <ServicesForm />\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ChapterSevenInfo\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport {\n  Route,\n  Link,\n  HashRouter\n} from 'react-router-dom'\nimport BankruptcyMenu from \"./BankruptcyMenu\";\nimport ServicesForm from \"../pages/ServicesForm\";\nimport Social from '../Social'\n\n\nclass ChapterThirteenInfo extends Component {\n\n\n  constructor (props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = ({\n      fromServices:false\n    })\n\n  }\n  componentDidMount () {\n    const { fromServices } = this.props.location.state || {}\n    console.log(fromServices)\n    if (!fromServices) {\n      window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n  render () {\n    var settings = {\n      dots: true,\n      centerMode: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      speed: 500,\n      slidesToShow: 1,\n      slidesToScroll: 1\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <div id='body'>\n\n        <div class='bankruptcy-banner'>\n\n\n          <div class='bankruptcy-hero'>\n            <h1>BANKRUPTCY</h1>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='services-pg-content-container '>\n          <div class='services-pg-div flex-col'>\n\n\n            <div class='flex-row services-pg-col-container'>\n              <div class='services-pg-col-1 flex-col'>\n\n\n                <div>\n                  <img class='services-pg-icon' src='assets/img/icons/moneyscale.png' /><h3>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Petition Preparation and Filing:</h3>\n\n                  <h4>What is Chapter 13 Bankruptcy?</h4>\n\n<p>By far, most people who run into financial hot-water ultimately file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7.  In some cases, however, an individual cannot file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy for legal reasons or it may be more advantageous to file under Chapter 13. </p>\n\n<p>The most common situations where someone may file for Chapter 13 is when you make too much money, you have too much equity in your property, you have filed for Chapter 7 too recently, most of your debt is not dischargeable under the bankruptcy code, or you have specific secured debts you would like to address.  </p>\n\n<p>In very limited detail, a Chapter 13 takes the following steps.  First, an individual with a regular source of income first proposes a plan of repayment.  Second, you obtain court approval of the plan.  Third, you make the plan payments over a number of years.  Generally speaking, the Chapter 13 plan is prepared by your attorney before the Petition is filed.  The length of a Chapter 13 plan is between three and five years.  </p>\n\n<p>A Trustee in a Chapter 13 has the responsibility of reviewing the plan before the Court approves the plan.  The Trustee makes the determination of whether the plan is feasible, whether you will be able to make the payments you propose under the plan, and whether the plan meets the legal requirements for Court approval.  After obtaining Court approval, you must execute and follow through with the plan.  </p>\n\n<h4>Who might a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy apply to? </h4>\n\n<p>If your income is substantial.  In Arizona, there is an economic test called the “means test” that determines if your income is more than the basic living expense.  Chapter 13 may apply to you if your household income exceeds the basic living expense and there is no other way to qualify you for a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.  </p>\n\n<p>If your property is worth more than the exemptions or is not exempt.  In other words, you have nice things.   You can keep your property in this case, but you will need to plan to pay your creditors the non-exempt portion to keep your property.</p>\n\n<p>If you have significant equity in your house and vehicle, want to keep your house and vehicle, but are not current on your debts payments.  It is possible to pay the arrears, keep payments current, and pay your house and vehicle debts during Chapter 13.  </p>\n\n<p>If you owe significant back taxes or child support.  Some debt, like most tax debt and child support, is not dischargeable.  If you are behind, It is possible to pay arrears on child support or tax creditors in Chapter 13 and establish a new payment plan that accurately suits your financial situation.  </p>\n\n\n<h4>How is a Chapter 13 different from a Chapter 7? </h4>\n\n<p>In a Chapter 7, you will surrender non-exempt assets that are sold for the benefit of creditors. In a Chapter 13, you will commit part of your future income, along with other assets you have committed to the plan, to be distributed to creditors. </p>\n\n<p>In a Chapter 7, you have very limited ability to change the nature of a debt by a secured creditor when the debt is in default and the creditor does not want to make a deal.  In a Chapter 13, you have the right to cure defaults over a period of time, even over the secured creditor’s objection.</p>\n\n<p>In a Chapter 7, obtaining a discharge usually takes about four to six months.  In a Chapter 13, obtaining a discharge (if there is a discharge available), will take between three and five years.  </p>\n\n<p>In a Chapter 7, the Bankruptcy Code determines what is distributed and to whom.  In a Chapter 13, the plan itself establishes how much and when creditors are to be paid.  </p>\n\n<h4>I’ve heard Chapter 13 Bankruptcies are hard to complete, is this true? </h4>\n\n<p>Yes, the fact of the matter is that most individuals who enter into a Chapter 13 plan are not successful. </p>\n\n<p>To succeed under a Chapter 13 plan, you have to have discipline and be willing to endure significant life-style changes.  Completion of a Chapter 13 plan is not impossible though and many individuals have achieved financial goals through execution of a Chapter 13.  With extra attention to details, finding extra cost savings in your day-to-day life, and enduring a little financial pain, Chapter 13 can be an excellent solution for certain individuals. </p>\n\n\n</div>\n              </div>\n\n              <div class=\"services-pg-col-2\">\n\n              <BankruptcyMenu />\n\n\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <Social />\n        <ServicesForm />\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ChapterThirteenInfo\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport {\n  Route,\n  Link,\n  HashRouter\n} from 'react-router-dom'\nimport BankruptcyMenu from \"./BankruptcyMenu\";\nimport ServicesForm from \"../pages/ServicesForm\";\nimport Social from '../Social'\n\n\n\nclass PreBankruptcyInfo extends Component {\n\n  componentDidMount () {\n    const { fromServices } = this.props.location.state || {}\n    console.log(fromServices)\n    if (!fromServices) {\n      window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  render () {\n    var settings = {\n      dots: true,\n      centerMode: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      speed: 500,\n      slidesToShow: 1,\n      slidesToScroll: 1\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <div id='body'>\n\n        <div class='bankruptcy-banner'>\n\n\n          <div class='bankruptcy-hero'>\n            <h1>BANKRUPTCY</h1>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='services-pg-content-container '>\n          <div class='services-pg-div flex-col'>\n\n\n            <div class='flex-row services-pg-col-container'>\n              <div class='services-pg-col-1 flex-col'>\n\n                <div>\n                  <img class='services-pg-icon' src='assets/img/icons/umbrella-icon.png' /><h3>Pre-Bankruptcy Planning:</h3>\n\n                  <p>In some cases, you may meet the legal requirements to file for bankruptcy today, but it is either not strategically right to file for bankruptcy just yet or there could be other reasons to delay filing.

In a no-asset bankruptcy, the person filing for bankruptcy does not own valuable enough property in order for the bankruptcy Trustee to seize the property, sell the property, and pay creditors. </p>\n\n                  <p>In other words, in a no-asset case, a potential outcome is retention of property and a discharge of the vast majority of your unsecured debt.  Such an outcome of minimal property loss and maximum discharge of debt is the goal of a good bankruptcy attorney.  If such a goal cannot be achieved by filing for bankruptcy, there are other solutions available, such as debt negotiation, consolidation, or settlement. </p>\n\n                  <p>In some situations, an individual, by law, will not qualify as a no-asset bankruptcy either because they make too much money, own too many valuable things, or for other reasons.  In those cases, the job of the bankruptcy attorney is slightly different, but the end outcome should be the same -- to preserve as much property as possible lawfully and discharge as much debt as possible lawfully under the bankruptcy laws. </p>\n\n                  <p>For some people, it is legally impossible to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  For example, the bankruptcy code only allows a person to file for bankruptcy once every eight years.  If someone filed for bankruptcy five years ago and is in need of bankruptcy protection again, Chapter 13 may be the solution.  There are many other reasons why someone may need to file under Chapter 13, in addition to timing considerations.            </p>\n\n                  <p>In conclusion, while the basic idea of bankruptcy is relatively straight forward, understanding and navigating the nuanced bankruptcy code is complex.  To fully understand the best strategies to protect you and your family from creditors, it is always wise to consider a consultation with a skilled bankruptcy attorney to discuss your personal situation.</p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink style={{zIndex:'9999'}} href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n                  <h4 id='faq2'>If I file for Bankruptcy, can I keep my home?</h4>\n\n                  <p>Most of the time, yes.  All situations are unique and deserve independent analysis, however, whether you keep your home or not will depend mostly around how much you owe on the house and how much your house is worth.  The difference between what you owe on your house and what your house is worth is considered “equity” in the home. </p>\n\n                  <p>Under Arizona law, if the equity in your home is $150,000 or less, proper usage and application of the “homestead exemption” in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case would provide an excellent avenue to protect your home.   Please note that you would still remain obligated to pay the mortgage on your house if you filed for Bankruptcy, but you certainly would not be forced to sell your house to pay unsecured creditors.            </p>\n\n                  <p>If the equity in your home exceeds $150,000, this situation is more difficult to explain, and the outcomes can be varied, depending on your personal financial situation, your desire, and nature of the debts.  Do not worry if the equity in your home does exceed $150,000.  With the help of a skilled bankruptcy attorney, there are still ways to structure a personal bankruptcy in order to preserve your primary family home.            </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id='faq3'>What if my house is in the foreclosure process right now?</h4>\n\n                  <p>If your home is presently in foreclosure, it is critical that you contact an attorney right away.            </p>\n\n                  <p>Let me repeat, if your house is presently in the foreclosure process, this is a big deal!

So, short answer -- no.            </p>\n\n                  <p>If you need to file for bankruptcy, it is your attorney’s job to help identify all exempt assets, similar to retirement accounts, and disclose these assets appropriately to the Bankruptcy Court and Trustee in your Petition filings to properly protect your exempt property from creditors.            </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id='faq5'>Will I lose my car if I file for Bankruptcy?</h4>\n\n                  <p>Maybe -- it depends on many factors.   For instance, how much is your car worth?  How much do you owe?  Are you married? Do you have any other vehicles that are fully paid off or nearly paid off? If so, how much are those vehicles worth?  Do you want to keep this particular car or would you be happy to get rid of the car to the lender for whatever reason?  Do you have multiple loans on the vehicle? </p>\n\n                  <p>In the event of financial problems, it is the job of your bankruptcy attorney to help you establish the best strategy for you, your family, and your given situation with respect to car ownership, the law, and life. </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id='faq6'>What is secured and unsecured debt?</h4>\n\n                  <p>The distinction between secured and unsecured debt is critical. The bankruptcy code treats secured debt differently than unsecured debt.            </p>\n\n                  <p>Put simply, secured debt are types of loans that are actually backed or secured by something, usually the item you bought with the loan.  The most common examples of secured debt are home mortgages and car loans.  In most cases, secured debt cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.  There are, however, exceptions to secondary mortgages and secondary car loans, that can be discharged in bankruptcy under certain circumstances. </p>\n\n                  <p>Unsecured debt are loans or credit lines that are based on your personal guarantee.  These are debts not secured by real estate or the purchased item.  These consumer debts commonly include credit card debt, medical debt, past-due rent, and all other debts driven by your guarantee to pay.  Unsecured debts, depending on your income and assets, are the most likely form of debt to be discharged in bankruptcy. </p>\n\n                  <p>A bankruptcy lawyer helps properly identify all of your debts, establish what is legally dischargeable, what is not dischargeable, and come up with the best plan for you.  In some cases, in consultation with an attorney, pre-bankruptcy planning is extremely helpful in order to maximize the amount of discharge. </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id=\"faq21\">What does it mean for debt to be too old?</h4>\n\n<p>Debt being “too old” is a way to talk about the Statute of Limitations to bring a breach of contract lawsuit against you.  Put another way, debt is “too old” if the time has passed for the creditor to bring a valid legal claim.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, in Arizona, a verbal contract or “open account” has a Statute of Limitation of three years from when the cause of action occurred.  The most common “open account” that people encounter in day-to-day life is emergency room medical debt. </p>\n\n<p>ARS § 12-543 (oral contracts) → <a href=\"https://www.azleg.gov/ars/12/00543.htm\" target=\"blank\">https://www.azleg.gov/ars/12/00543.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>A written contract in Arizona maintains a Statute of Limitation of six years from when the cause of action occurred.  This includes credit card debt.  Credit card debt that has been sold onto many collection firms for a number of years, after the card went into default for several years, is an example of when debt may become too old to bring a valid lawsuit against you.  </p>\n\n<p>ARS § 12-548 (written contracts) → <a href=\"https://www.azleg.gov/ars/12/00548.htm\" target=\"blank\">https://www.azleg.gov/ars/12/00548.htm</a> </p>\n\n<p>Please Note --  It is necessary to consult with a licenced attorney when calculating the Statute of Limitations of any given claim or cause of action.  While the basics on the surface seem simple, there are also complex, nuanced, and detailed aspects of calculating Statutes of Limitations for every specific case that only an attorney can fully assess. </p>\n\n<p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"faq22\">What other possible defenses to debt lawsuits are there?</h4>\n\n<p>In some rare cases, you can challenge whether you were served with legal documents correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Service of Process Rule 4.1 of the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://govt.westlaw.com/azrules/Document/N96ABD6F086DC11E699A4BB097EBD55F8?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&bhcp=1\" target=\"_blank\">https://govt.westlaw.com/azrules/Document/N96ABD6F086DC11E699A4BB097EBD55F8?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&bhcp=1</a></p>\n\n<p>On occasion, you may also be able to challenge whether a debt-buying firm actually has the proper paperwork and legal “standing” to sue you.  You must answer and respond to the creditors lawsuit if you think this defense applies to you.</p>\n\n<p>Another example of valid debt defense is when you are sued by a credit card company after being the victim of criminal identity theft or fraud.  In such situations, you do NOT want to admit responsibility to these charges and must present a timely defense with evidence in Court that you never authorized the charges.</p>\n\n\n                  <h4 id='faq7'>What about student loans?            </h4>\n\n                  <p>Even though a student loan may seem like an unsecured loan because it is not secured by anything other than your promise to pay, the bankruptcy code treats student loans differently than other unsecured debt. Unfortunately, the current state of bankruptcy law as applied to student loans is not favorable to borrowers.  Most student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  There are limited exceptions, but, in general, it is very difficult to get student loans discharged through bankruptcy.            </p>\n\n                  <p>If you are behind on student loans, there are other options besides bankruptcy, such as loan consolidation, forbearance on payments due to economic hardship, or applying to be placed into affordable income based repayment plans for Federal student loans. </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id='faq8'>Will a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy stop wage garnishments? </h4>\n\n                  <p>Yes, in most situations.  Once you file for bankruptcy, an “automatic stay” will be put in place on all collection efforts by your creditors.  This includes wage garnishments.   In certain circumstances, it is possible to recover past wage garnishments that have already been seized by creditors through the bankruptcy process. </p>\n\n                  <p>If your wages are being garnished presently, or your creditors are threatening to garnish your wages, and you are worried, please consider contacting a bankruptcy attorney who can help you right away.            </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id='faq9'>How long will the whole Bankruptcy process take?</h4>\n\n                  <p>This depends on the type of bankruptcy you file, how quickly you acquire all the necessary documentation, how backed up the bankruptcy courts are due to COVID precautions, and a number of other factors.            </p>\n\n                  <p>Expect at least four to six months from start to finish for most Chapter 7 bankruptcies. </p>\n\n                  <p>Under a very fast scenario, without any delays whatsoever, from start to finish on a Chapter 7 no-asset case, could be completed in as little as four to six weeks. </p>\n\n                  <p>Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings are long and slow.  Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings can last between three and five years, sometimes longer. </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id='faq20'>I’m drowning in Student Loan debt.  Can you explain in a little more detail about the student loan discharge process in bankruptcy?</h4>\n\n                  <p>Unless and until the Federal Government acts on comprehensive Student Loan Reform and related Bankruptcy reform, the current state of the law presents a number of barriers to obtaining an easy, quick, or clean discharge of student loan debt in bankruptcy.</p>\n\n                  <p>This does NOT mean it is impossible to obtain a discharge, however, it is a trying and slow process that entails a number of procedural tasks and legal elements that must be satisfied.</p>\n\n                  <p>The general state of the law is codified under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8).  This section of the bankruptcy code provides that student loans are excepted from the discharge a debtor receives in bankruptcy unless repaying those loans would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor’s dependents.</p>\n\n                  <p>In United Student Aid Funds v. Pena (In re Pena), 155 F.3d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir. 1998), the Ninth Circuit adopted the three-pronged test set out in Brunner, 831 F.2d 395 at 396 (2nd. Cir. 1987), to determine whether the undue hardship standard has been met for a particular debtor in a particular situation.</p>\n\n                  <p>The three prongs require a showing: (1) that the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a minimal standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans; (2) that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans; and (3) the debtor made good faith efforts to repay the loans.</p>\n\n                  <p>If your factual situation meets the basic elements of the Brunner Test and you desire to begin the long and arduous process to have your student loans discharged, you must file an Adversary Proceeding and related Complaint to Determine Dischargeability.  This Adversary Proceeding and Complaint to Determine Dischargeability is separate from your Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Petition.</p>\n\n                  <p>After the Bankruptcy Petition and related Adversary Proceeding is filed and pre-trial proceedings (including discovery) are conducted, a trial will eventually be held in front of a Bankruptcy Judge.  The Bankruptcy Judge will hear testimony and weigh evidence on whether your particular situation meets the Brunner factors.  Just like any trial, the opposing party(ies), the Student loan Issuer and Servicer, will be represented by an attorney and will be presented an opportunity to offer evidence in support of their case that the loans should not be discharged.</p>\n\n                  <p>After hearing the facts of the case and applying the facts to the state of the law, the Bankruptcy Judge then possesses the power to order your student loans discharged or not.  The whole process takes several years to complete, but may be worth it if your loans are large enough, your personal situation satisfies the Brunner factors, and significant financial relief can be obtained for you.</p>\n\n                  <p class=\"bold\">How much will it cost to hire a lawyer to help me with this process?</p>\n\n                  <p>There is no one fixed rate or fee for services with Alex Coomer Law.

In other words, good pre-bankruptcy planning protects your stuff, gets you the largest legal discharge available, and provides the best foundation possible for your life coming out of bankruptcy.</p>\n\n                  <p>For example, without proper pre-bankruptcy planning and assistance from an attorney, it is possible you may surrender most (if not all) of your tax refund.  An ill-timed filing at the end of the calendar year when you are anticipating a big refund will likely result in the Trustee keeping your case open until your refund arrives and taking your refund to pay creditors a portion of the debt owed.  If you regularly receive a large tax refund, discussion with an attorney as to the optimal time to file and how to spend your tax refund properly prior to filing is highly advised.</p>\n\n                  <p>Another classic example where proper pre-bankruptcy planning with an attorney is helpful is when you have way too much equity in automobiles, own lots of vehicles, and you must transition non-exempt assets into exempt assets prior to filing.   With the guidance of an attorney, you can sell the vehicles you do not want to keep and with the sale proceeds of the vehicles know exactly what you can buy, how much you can spend, and the timing of this process to accumulate helpful exempt assets to your family (i.e. stuff you get to keep even though you are filing for bankruptcy). </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id=\"faq24\">Won’t Pre-Bankruptcy Planning slow down my filing? </h4>\n\n                  <p>Yes, in theory, your filing date can be pushed back in order to Pre-Bankruptcy plan properly. BUT, this sort of pre-bankruptcy strategy will only be done to maximize value in your case for you as applied to your given situation. </p>\n\n                  <p>In some cases, such as a pending home foreclosure or where there are heavy wage garnishments already in place, there may not be any incentive or financial reasons to pre-bankruptcy plan to the same degree and filing your case quickly will be the priority. </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id=\"faq25\">Is Pre-Bankruptcy Planning expensive?  </h4>\n\n                  <p>No, in fact, there is usually no separate charge for pre-bankruptcy planning.  At Alex Coomer Law, Pre-Bankruptcy planning is typically built into the flat fee price designed for your case and your situation.  Pre-Bankruptcy planning is simply good legal work. </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id='faq10'>What exactly is a Trustee? </h4>\n\n                  <p>When a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy Petition is filed, a Trustee will be appointed to the case by the Bankruptcy Court. </p>\n\n                  <p>In a Chapter 7, the Trustee’s job is to assess the Bankruptcy Petition and establish if it is a no-asset bankruptcy or if there are assets that need to be seized.  If there are no assets, the Trustee’s job is fairly straightforward and the case will likely be finished within a matter of weeks. </p>\n\n                  <p>If there are assets to be sold, the Trustee’s job is to acquire the assets, sell them (“liquidation”), and distribute the proceeds to creditors in accordance with bankruptcy law. Unfortunately, the timeline on this process is uncertain as it takes the Trustee an uncertain amount of time to complete the job. </p>\n\n                  <p>In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the Trustee’s job is far more complex and the role of the Trustee will depend greatly on the specific situation of the person filing for bankruptcy and the creditors.            </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id='faq11'>What if I have a lot of personal property?  Why can’t I give my property to a friend or family member?</h4>\n\n                  <p>It is a very bad idea to transfer any property or interests in real estate to family members or friends if you are contemplating bankruptcy.  In some cases, such behavior can result in your potential bankruptcy case being dismissed and will delay any future bankruptcy filing for a period of years.  In other more serious cases, such behavior can result in possible criminal bankruptcy fraud charges. </p>\n\n                  <p>It is the job of the resourceful Trustee, appointed by the Bankruptcy Court, to verify that non-exempt assets that could have been used to pay creditors were not illegally transferred, sold, or moved prior to filing for bankruptcy. </p>\n\n                  <p>Bankruptcy is a process for the honest debtor.  Bankruptcy is not a process designed to hide, scam, cheat, or defraud your creditors. (Emphasis added).            </p>\n\n                  <p>If you have moved or transferred property and are now nervous, there are potential solutions that a bankruptcy attorney can suggest.  It is not the end of the world if you think you made a mistake with respect to the transfer of property because a good bankruptcy attorney can help you navigate the process back. </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id='faq12'>Why are Bankruptcy lawyers helpful? </h4>\n\n                  <p>Is it possible, and completely legal, for someone to represent themselves in their own bankruptcy proceeding?  Absolutely. </p>\n\n                  <p>Do many people successfully navigate a bankruptcy on their own?  Absolutely. </p>\n\n                  <p>Is it stressful, difficult, and risky to file for bankruptcy on your own?  Absolutely.            </p>\n\n                  <p>Bankruptcy law is a combination of contract law, property law, secured transactions, tax law, administrative law, civil procedure, family law, math, and lots of paper-work.  In addition, bankruptcy law combines federal law with state law, thereby adding to the complications. </p>\n\n                  <p>Your bankruptcy lawyer is there to make sure the details don’t get missed, every exemption is sought, and all discharges are maximized with as little stress and work on you as possible. You will need to work closely and diligently with providing documents and information to your bankruptcy lawyer, but the heavy lifting will never be on your shoulders. </p>\n\n                  <p>The idea is this -- a good bankruptcy attorney provides you peace of mind.  How much is this worth to you? </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n                  <h4 id=\"faq26\">I’ve talked to several bankruptcy attorneys, but I do not know who I should hire.  Should I just hire the attorney who quoted me the cheapest fee?  Are bankruptcy attorneys all the same?  </h4>\n\n                  <p>Cost is obviously a major factor when it comes to your decision as to who to hire as your attorney, but it is not the only thing to consider.  </p>\n\n                  <p>Every attorney is different. Consider the big picture.  Going through a personal debt crisis, business failure, or bankruptcy will be emotionally difficult for most people and, for some especially, it is critically important to have a lawyer who you connect with personally, who listens to you intently at all times, and who you know has your back. </p>\n\n                  <p>If you find it difficult to get in touch or garnish the attention of your attorney, this is a red flag and likely someone you do not want to work with.   You are NOT a number.   Please be wary of “bankruptcy mills” in Tucson and Southern Arizona.  Bankruptcy mills work and operate on volume.  A volume business model makes it difficult for you to obtain the personal relationship you should have with your attorney.  </p>\n\n                  <p>Finally, the bankruptcy process is not particularly fast.  You will be working closely with your bankruptcy lawyer during the preparation of the bankruptcy petition for several months, maybe longer. </p>\n\n                  <p>For these practical reasons, you want to hire a lawyer you like.  You want a lawyer you want to work with during this trying process.  Debt resolution, loan modifications, and bankruptcy are difficult things to go through.  To make sure the process is as painless as possible for you, it is important to have a true and genuine relationship with your attorney.  </p>\n\n                  <p>Put simply -- don’t be fooled by the lowest cost attorney.  There is more to the equation in assessing who is the right attorney for you.  </p>\n                  <p class=\"back-to-top\"><AnchorLink href='#top'>Back to Top ^ </AnchorLink></p>\n\n\n                  <h4 id='faq13'>How much do your bankruptcy services cost? </h4>\n\n                  <p>There is no one set fixed fee for bankruptcy services at Alex Coomer Law, PLLC. </p>\n\n                  <p>A good way to understand why there is no one set fee is through analogy.
