	<p>If you are thinking about filing for bankruptcy, a critical factor is to decide when you actually file the case.  In other words, if you choose to file for bankruptcy, you must establish the optimal date to file the case to obtain the greatest relief in terms of the largest discharge with incurring the least risk of anything going wrong.  The fact of the matter is that bankruptcy law is nuanced and timing considerations are baked into and throughout the code.  Timing issues create pitfalls if you don’t know what to look out for.  It takes awareness of these timing issues and careful planning to increase the value and chance of success of any bankruptcy petition.</p>
<p>This article will address five timing considerations every bankruptcy petition preparer and filer should think about when deciding the appropriate date to file a case.</p>
<h3 class="headlines main-bg"><span class="bold">1.) Tax Refund</span> -- Are you going to be receiving a tax refund this year?  If so, how much will the refund be?</h3>
<div class="text-indent-div">
<p>In a standard Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, the “property of the estate” is established at the moment in time when your case is filed.  Property of the estate is a fancy way of describing all of the things you own or have a legal ownership stake in at that very specific moment in time when you filed the case.  In bankruptcy law, what is considered property of the estate is incredibly broad and property of the estate includes everything you know you own and even things that you don’t know you own.</p>
<p>Usually, people who are filing for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy do not consider or realize that their annual Tax Refund is property of their estate.  However, the resourceful Trustee in your case knows that your Tax Refund is property of the estate because this is money that the government owes to you for the previous tax year.  This is why it is called a tax “refund.”  The issue is that if you file your case at the wrong time when this money is still owed to you, you will have to turn this tax refund money over to the Trustee to pay creditors upon receiving your tax money, if you want to obtain your discharge.</p>
<p>For example, if you file your bankruptcy case on November 15, 2020 and your family routinely receives a tax refund, this is a problem.  In this hypothetical situation, the tax refund to be issued in 2021 is property of your estate and is not able to be protected or exempted under Arizona law.  In this case, you would need to expect the Trustee to ask you to hand over a large portion of your refund owed to you for the 2020 tax year before you would receive a discharge of debt.   So, what is the solution if you need to file bankruptcy and are expecting a sizable refund?</p>
<p>The solution here is to be aware, have a plan, and be mindful of timing.  If your situation allows for it, the best way to handle a tax refund is to delay the filing of the case until your refund has been issued to your family and the refund is spent strategically on exempt assets.  This is considered pre-bankruptcy planning.  This strategy will allow your family to keep more assets even though you filed a bankruptcy case.  Working with a skilled bankruptcy lawyer on figuring out the best plan for you and your family with respect to tax refunds is a critical part of handling a bankruptcy case properly.</p>

<h3 class="headlines main-bg"><span class="bold"> 2.) Employment – </span> Are you unemployed presently?  Is your employment status changing in the near future? Are you starting a new job soon?</h3>
<div class="text-indent-div">
<p>When deciding when is the right time for you to file your bankruptcy case, never forget the expression -- “You can’t get blood from a Turnip.”  In other words, your creditors can not get something from you, especially money, if you do not have it.</p>
<p>Unsecured creditors cannot garnish employment wages if you are not employed.  Unsecured creditors cannot levy bank accounts if there is no money in the bank account to take.</p>
<p>If you are dealing with unsecured creditors calling every day and harassing you, but you are unemployed, have no income otherwise, nothing in your bank account, and have nothing to pay the creditors, you may be making a mistake filing for bankruptcy too soon.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the conventional wisdom is to wait until you have started new employment with steady income and then file for bankruptcy quickly before the creditors can garnish wages.  Under this strategy you are able to seek your maximum discharge and are able to keep a bankruptcy off of your record prior to landing another job.</p>
<p>Not all employers care whether you file for bankruptcy or not, but some employers do care a lot.  Keeping options open when you are unemployed is very important and filing a bankruptcy case too early can pose some issues.  You obviously still risk being terminated by your employer upon filing the bankruptcy case as Arizona is an “at-will” employment State, but often employers are less concerned about this filing once you have begun work and established yourself as a valuable member of the team.   In fact, it can be explained to your employer that you are now more valuable to them with the case being filed because you will be far less stressed out with finances (assuming the bankruptcy discharge is ultimately ordered) and more focused on your job.</p>
<p>There are, of course, exceptions to this general rule about delaying a filing until obtaining a new job.  These exceptions include if you are expecting to make a sizable annual wage on your next job, are facing immediate foreclosure, or if you own secured assets you want to keep that creditors can seize without the immediate protection of bankruptcy automatic stay.</p>

<h3 class="headlines main-bg"><span class="bold"> 3.) Income --  </span> Is your income built around seasonal income or a holiday bonus?</h3>
<div class="text-indent-div">
<p>When determining if one qualifies for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy for purposes of median  income, the operative income time range to consider is the last six months of money earned.   In effect, this means that some people may qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy during a period of the year, but do not qualify for a Chapter 7 at other time ranges within the very same year due to irregular seasonal income.  This happens most frequently with people who have seasonal employment or obtain income from seasonal rental properties.</p>
<p>If you mostly earn seasonal income, careful planning and considerations with respect to your prior earnings is REALLY important.  Careful assessment of income and timing when you file may be the difference between qualifying for a short-and-sweet Chapter 7 bankruptcy with a substantial discharge versus a three to five year Chapter 13 bankruptcy where you may pay many of your unsecured creditors back a portion of what is owed and a percentage to the Trustee over the life of the case.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="headlines main-bg"><span class="bold"> 4.) Insider Payments –   </span> Have you paid any loans off recently?  Have you paid back any family members or friends you own money to?</h3>
<div class="text-indent-div">
<p>The bankruptcy code frowns on paying off certain creditors at the expense of other creditors.  This is known as a preferential payment or a payment to an insider.</p>
<p>For example, if you owe a lot in credit card debt to the big banks and also owe credit card debt to your local credit union, but you only choose to pay your credit union back within 90 days prior to filing for bankruptcy, this will cause you problems in your case.  The laws do not allow you to pay one creditor back and seek discharge of debt in bankruptcy of the other creditors within 90 days without consequence.</p>
<p>To avoid issues here, you must be considerate of when your last payments were made and possibly have to wait the appropriate amount of time to file the case.   Similarly, if you choose to pay family or friends back at the expense of creditors prior to filing your case, this also can create issues and must be considered with respect to the optimal time to file for bankruptcy.  Insider payments to family members are trickier to solve and can take some time, but these problems are necessary to plan for and work out in order to obtain a discharge of debt in a bankruptcy case.</p></div>

<h3 class="headlines main-bg"><span class="bold"> 5.) Debts Owed to You –  </span> Does anyone owe you any money?  Do you have a claim against anyone else?</h3>
<div class="text-indent-div">
<p>Nearly identical to the property of the estate logic contained within the tax refund issue described above, if you are owed money by anyone, you do not want to file a bankruptcy case until you are paid back, are assured you will not being getting paid back (i.e. the other party is a turnip), or you just cannot wait any longer to file your case for other reasons.</p>
<p>On your bankruptcy petition, you will need to let the Court and the Trustee know if anyone owes money to you or if you have a legal claim against anyone else.  This money owed to you or your claim against another party is property of your estate and the Trustee will want that property.  If you file a case too early and have not actually collected on this money or pursued your claim fully, the Trustee will take your place and seek to collect your money to pay creditors.   This is why, sometimes, even though you may qualify for bankruptcy, it might be best to wait to file a case and to pursue the collections or claim you have against others first.</p>
</div>
	<p>In conclusion, when you file a bankruptcy case involves a complex assessment of a number of variables.  Some cases certainly are less complex than others, but all cases deserve a careful and detailed analysis.  This is fundamentally why it is valuable to hire a lawyer to assist you with filing for bankruptcy.  The truth of the matter is -- you don’t know what you don’t know until you know it.  With bankruptcy, it is often too late once you learn your lesson and it is always advised to, at least, get a free consultation with a bankruptcy attorney if you are contemplating filing.</p>
