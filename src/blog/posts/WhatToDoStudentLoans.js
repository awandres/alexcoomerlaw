	<p>The current dollar figures of consumer debt held by Americans are staggering.   Approximately 42 million people hold $1.6 Trillion in student loan debt<sup>1</sup>.  To compare, the country as a whole, 320 million + people, holds approximately $1 Trillion in credit card debt<sup>2</sup>.   To be clear -- both figures are substantial sums of cash borrowed by Americans and each form of debt creates unique problems for families to repay during an economic recession.  The major difference between these two forms of debt though is that there are many good options when credit card debt becomes overwhelming.  There are non-profit debt relief organizations that help with structuring affordable repayment plans, consolidation loans are available for some borrowers, and, most importantly, credit card debt is routinely discharged in bankruptcy when the debt becomes too great for an individual and their family.  In this way, people do see light at the end of the tunnel and there are relatively simplified legal means available for a fresh start due to credit card debt. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the vast majority of student loan holders never obtain any form of debt relief.  Instead, most student loan borrowers continue to struggle for life with repaying student loan debt, enduring painful wage garnishments, and the government taking your annual tax refund.  While student loan discharge in bankruptcy is legally possible under our current laws, discharge in bankruptcy remains exceedingly rare.  In fact, most people who file for bankruptcy and who hold student loan debt never even bother to seek student loan debt discharge during their case, even though it likely could be beneficial. <sup>3</sup> </p>

	<p>In order to solve this on-going student loan debt crisis, several politicians are presenting plans for student loan debt forgiveness.   Figures have been floated from between $10,000 to $50,000 worth of forgiveness, including up to 100% forgiveness of all student debt.  In light of the level of partisan politics in our country right now, it can be debated about the realistic chance of such debt forgiveness legislation passing.  This article is not about politics.  This article is about explaining why debt forgiveness is likely not the best solution to this pending problem in the first place and providing other, better, legislative options to pursue. </p>

<p>Why is student loan debt forgiveness a bad idea?  First, debt forgiveness is wrought with moral pitfalls<sup>4</sup>.  The biggest one of which is that debt forgiveness has serious potential to subsidize the rich and the privileged at the expense of the poor.  There are other fairness issues, including the fact that those who have higher earning jobs on the back end of school will likely have more debt and will enjoy a bigger windfall from student loan debt forgiveness than those who borrowed less and earn less.  In addition, debt forgiveness opens up the door to tax liability issues for those who theoretically enjoy substantial debt forgiveness<sup>5</sup>.  If our solution as a country is for people to trade one form of debt for another, albeit in a smaller amount, I’m disappointed in our politicians’ ability to problem solve.  Put another way, debt swapping simply is not a solution.  Moreover, massive debt forgiveness does not do anything to fix the future problem moving forward about the excessive cost of higher education and how future students will affordably finance education. Instead of an over-simplified debt forgiveness program, I proffer that there are a number of other ways, which all work together, that can address this issue holistically and do not have the same moral shortcomings as outright debt forgiveness. </p>

<p>The first step is to forgive ALL accumulated Interest on Student Loans and peg all student loan borrowing at 0% moving forward.  Personally, this author is offended by the fact that the government is charging between 6.8%-7.8% on student loans when the rate of borrowing is presently so much cheaper for other forms of consumer debt.  The unfortunate reality is that a high interest rate on high dollar figures borrowed, like student loans, is why many consumers end up paying minimum payments for decades without actually knocking any of the original principal amount owed down.  It is a debt hole of death.  Even despite your best effort to make timely payments, the debt does not go down and can sometimes just keep getting bigger and bigger.   This sort of debt cycle must be stopped and addressed by Congress as consumers simply cannot and do not have the financial leverage to get themselves out on their own.  </p>

<p>The obvious and easy solution here is to fix the interest rate on student loans to 0% and forgive all interest charges that have accumulated to date.  In other words, Congress should legislate forgiveness of just accumulated interest on student loans over the years and not forgive the student loan principal balance itself.  At the same time, any payments made to date by the borrower should retroactively apply to principal amounts borrowed and not to interest accumulation. Interest payments made by borrowers who already paid their student loans back in-full should be refunded.  The government has no reason to profit on the back of student loan borrowers or create a debt cycle that is impossible to emerge from.   From a purely academic tax-income perspective, forgiveness of interest accumulation is different from forgiveness of actual income received in the forms of dispersed student loans.  Therefore, any tax liability issues may be easily solved by clarifying any interest that is forgiven is not considered taxable income.  </p>

<p>Further, if interest rates are pegged at 0% moving forward for all student loan borrowing, there is much less complexity for borrowers to understand when calculating how long it will take to pay the loan back.  This article acknowledges that figuring out a solution to repay private student loan lenders and their interest on their loans is a separate issue entirely.  Fortunately, private student loan lenders only hold approximately 7.8% of all student loan debt. <sup>6</sup> </p>

<p>The second step is that the Bankruptcy Code must be modified to make student loan discharge more viable.  This means a simplified code that relaxes the <i>Brunner</i><sup>7</sup> standard and creates a less burdensome procedure to accomplish student loan discharge.  Under the present system, in order to even argue for student loan discharge, one must file an “adversary proceeding”.  An adversary proceeding is separate and apart from the underlying bankruptcy case itself where you present evidence to a Bankruptcy Judge that a debtor satisfies the Brunner standard.  This is, in effect, another independent lawsuit that demands its own litigation within a Chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy case.  </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, adversary proceedings are complex, time-consuming, and expensive for the borrower.  Adversary proceedings follow their own unique rules of procedure, different from standard civil lawsuits at your local Superior Court, and these cases usually require an attorney that specializes in this field of law.  In addition, adversary proceeding student loan discharge cases usually take several years or longer to complete.  This specialized expertise and serious time involved by the attorney, obviously, comes at a price to the borrower.  Due to these cost and time impediments, most people who file for bankruptcy never bother trying to seek student loan discharge or even know the option exists.   </p>

<p class="citations"><sup>7 </sup>The three prongs of the Brunner test require a showing: (1) that the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a minimal standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans; (2) that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans; and (3) the debtor made good faith efforts to repay the loans.  Brunner, 831 F.2d 395 at 396 (2nd. Cir. 1987).  </p>

<p>Thus, this author believes there is a real synergy with a combination of interest forgiveness and bankruptcy reform to start fixing the student loan crisis.  The idea is simple at the core of it --  allow those with the means to pay the loan back to be able to actually pay the loan back due to 0% interest and at the same time still provide new streamlined forms of relief to those that simply must seek bankruptcy protection because the debt is far too substantial to repay.  Stay tuned on future blog posts for nitty-gritty suggestions on how to change the bankruptcy code to accommodate such a streamlined process.  </p>

<p>And, finally, it has to be mentioned that society as a whole must address the ever-rising cost of higher education and be willing to increase the severity of penalties for predatory lending in the student loan system.  These final points are beyond the scope of this article, but these ideas deserve unique analysis as without addressing the root cause of unaffordable education, it is more than likely we will find ourselves back here again if we don’t also try to fix the fundamental issue of higher education costs. </p>

<p>In conclusion, a major debt crisis with student loans is unfolding in front of our very eyes.  Unless addressed and solved holistically, this problem will not go away on its own.  It is time for Congress to act.  If action is not taken, the likely outcome is that families will suffer financially for decades, higher education will decline in availability, and the collective education of our country will go down.  While this author acknowledges there are multiple ways to go about solving this student loan issue, including the suggestions offered above, it is clear that a careful and long-term approach to fixing the student loan borrowing system is necessary to solve in order to strengthen the collective financial health of the country. </p>
