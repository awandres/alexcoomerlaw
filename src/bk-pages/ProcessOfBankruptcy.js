Please be aware that this initial consultation packet and first series of documents is quite long and will take time to complete.

                    {' '} If you choose to hire Alex as your lawyer, you will need to make some sort of payment to retain his services.

                    {' '} The final few steps depend on if your case is a no-asset case or if there are assets to be sold.  If there are no assets, the next step can be as little as two or three more weeks, depending on the speed of the Trustee.  If there are assets to sell, this may take a significant period of time to resolve.</p>
                  <p class='numbered-p'><span class='numbered-list'>16.)</span>
                    {' '} After the necessary work is completed by the Trustee, the Trustee will compose a final report and make a recommendation to the Bankruptcy Judge.
